<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
When life gives you lemons, make limoncello.<br><br>
Isn&#8217;t that how the saying goes?<br><br>
Lemon martinis?<br><br>
No?<br><br>
Let&#8217;s try again.<br><br>
When life gives you lemons,<br><br>
MAKE COOKIES. There.  That&#8217;s definitely it.<br><br>
Those who don&#8217;t necessarily share my baking addiction, rejoice; these simple fresh &#8220;cook&#8221;-ies do not require any cooking at all!<br><br>

This recipe is a new take on lemon cookies to celebrate the winter &#8211;&gt; spring transition. Fresh squeezed organic Meyer lemons come together and mingle with nutty coconut flour, hearty almond meal, and fiber-packed chia seeds to form vibrant little morsels that melt in your mouth.  Sweet and tart&#8230;a cookie that speaks to both sides of my soul.  Give them a whirl.  And for the love of Buddha, don&#8217;t try to eat just one at a time.
<br><br>
IT DOESN&#8217;T WORK PEOPLE.<br><br>
ALL CAPS BECAUSE THIS IS SERIOUS BIDNESS.

<!--Recipe Serving-->
<h2>Makes about 20 cookies, ~120 calories per cookie</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">1.5 cups almond meal (NOT almond flour&#8230;you can make your own almond meal by grinding blanched whole almonds, or buy some pre-ground shiet)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2/3 cup coconut flour</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/3 cup coconut oil</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3 fresh organic lemons</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 T chia seeds</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">4 T honey or agave nectar</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp sea salt</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">a little sugar and sea salt (optional, but recommended for sprinklin&#8217; and to roll the cookies in)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 cup shredded coconut (optional, but recommended to roll the cookies in)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>My food processor was made for ants and is incredibly small, so I had to make these in two batches.  I had to combine all the ingredients (except the last two listed above for garnish) into a medium-sized bowl first, and THEN mix them up a bit with a wooden spoon before I put two separate batches in.  If you have a normal-sized food processor (like a real, live adult), skip the bowl step and just add in all the ingredients straight into the food processor!</li>
<li>Next, get jiggy with the &#8220;pulse&#8221; button for a bit, and then taaaa-da: the dough is formed!</li>
<li>Roll the dough into small(ish) size drops with your hands and then sprinkle with a little sugar and sea salt.  Put the shredded coconut in a small bowl and roll each drop into the bowl to coat sufficiently. Put the cookies on a plate, not touching.</li>
<li>Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes before serving.  These freeze wonderfully, pee ess.</li>

You know what beats happy hour out at a restaurant?<br><br>
Happy hour in my kitchen.<br><br>
Because it&#8217;s cheaper and I don&#8217;t have to wear pants.<br><br>
I set out to make an all-natural tequila sunrise with a huge box of oranges I inherited from work the other day.  I thought to myself, &#8220;Great, I&#8217;ll juice these, add some strawberries and tequila and YAY.&#8221;  And then I could not locate the most essential piece to my juicer.  How <del>weird</del> typical. I figured all was lost but then I thought, well, what the hell&#8230;so I threw some peeled oranges, strawberries, a couple slices of fresh ginger (which was of a questionable age as it has been buried in my veggie drawer for quite some time now&#8230;), and tequila into my little Magic Bullet blender.<br><br>
And&#8230;<br><br>
OH MY LAWDY. This is one of the most delicious and refreshing cocktails I have <strong>ever</strong> had.<br><br>
Can you tell I had fun making these?<br><br>
I definitely drank a whole one while photographing this recipe. It was Saturday. So sue me.<br><br>
Actually, booooooze me&#8230;<br><br>
Make this drink for your guests on a warm day, it&#8217;s like a slushy but naturally sweetened and with the added benefit of fresh ginger (which is a digestive aid) and alcohol (which is a new- friend-making/dating aid).  Who knew.  Plus the oranges and strawberries give you a double dose of immunity-boosting Vitamin C.<br><br>
This cocktail is da bidness; the ginger adds an invigorating kick and balances out the sweetness of the oranges with the sharpness of the tequila.  All I could say was, &#8220;Ole&#8221; as I fainted into tequila sunrise oblivion.  Hope this brightens up your Monday!

<h1>Tropical Salmon With Coconut Black Rice</h1>

<p id="description">

Coming home from vacation is always bittersweet.  One second you&#8217;re skipping along singing kumbaya because it was so beautiful and the sun was so pretty and that IPA was so frosty and then the next, you&#8217;re ready to break down into tears when you see that leaning tower of pisa pile of laundry and the 18 unopened bills smashed into your mailbox.  I must say, though, that the good always outweighs the bad and I feel rejuvenated and blissful.<br><br>
I hiked, I laughed, I climbed more than a few trees.  Life is good:)  Culinarily speaking, it was hit or miss.  My brother decided Top Ramen was good trail food and so I ended up eating my body weight in <a title="Sweet &amp; Salty Granola Bars" href="http://thesavvysweetpotato.com/2014/03/sweet-salty-granola-bars/" target="_blank">Sweet &amp; Salty granola bars</a>.  But, we did go out to a few fancy shmancy restaurants in Los Angeles and I had some delicious seared tuna one night and some sushi another. Naturally, it evoked in me a burning desire to cast out my fishing pole and catch what I could for dinner at home.  Hah.  And by that I mean defrost some frozen fish and get to cookin&#8217;. I may get down down in the kitchen from time to time but this isn&#8217;t Cast Away, mkay?<br><br>
I don&#8217;t cook fish very often because I usually prefer it grilled in the summertime.  Whatta&#8217; snob. But because the grill and I got more beef than Biggie and 2Pac, this means a person who knows how to properly use the grill is a necessity.  I usually cook alone. This renders me hopeless, and also lame.<br><br>
A fish dish for me most likely translates into throwing some olive oil on a fillet of salmon, dousing it in a hefty cloud of salt and pepper, and throwing it in the oven for 10 minutes. Nothing very fancy and nothing worth posting. However, this past summer I remember someone who was grill-certified (hint: not me) grilling up some mahi mahi one evening and I paired it with a mango chutney and brown rice cooked in coconut milk.  It turned out pretty groovy to say the least. I wanted to incorporate something equally interesting with the salmon I bought at Trader Joe&#8217;s months ago that is about to transpire into fillet-o-freezer-burn.<br><br>
Enter: marinated salmon with a tropical fruit relish and ginger coconut forbidden black rice.<br><br>
Welcome, welcome.<br><br>
Sounds legit, right? This salmon is also cooked in a pan and not on the grill so it is dummy-proof.  Unless you are more of a dummy than me (who is still unable to beat anyone at a game of Candy Land) which is pretty much, I have decided, a physical impossibility.<br><br>
Moving ahead.  Sorta obsessed with this recipe. In this refreshing take on glazed salmon, the rich tropical fruit pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the glaze and also against the nutty chewiness of the black rice.  If you have never tried black &#8220;forbidden&#8221; rice, which actually cooks up sort of purple, you won&#8217;t be disappointed. Find it by the normal rice (duh) or in the bulk bins!


</p>

<hr>





<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients"><p style="text-align: left;">For the salmon:</p>
<ul>
<li>about 1 lb or two decent-sized fillets of salmon</li>
<li>1 T honey or agave nectar</li>
<li>2 tsp soy sauce or wheat-free tamari sauce</li>
<li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
<li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
<li>1/4 tsp minced fresh ginger</li>
<li>juice from half a lime</li>
</ul>
<p>For the fruit relish:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 ripe mango</li>
<li>1 ripe kiwi</li>
<li>1 or 2 large strawberries</li>
<li>1/4 cup cilantro</li>
<li>1/4 cup orange juice (fresh squeezed, if possible)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rice:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup black &#8220;forbidden&#8221; rice</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
<li>1 T minced fresh ginger</li>
<li>1/4 cup cilantro</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 T coconut oil</li>
<li>juice from half a lime</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Begin by making the rice!  From the rice section of the ingredient list, heat up the coconut oil over medium in a decent sized pot. Once it&#8217;s melted, add the T of ginger and cook until fragrant (a couple minutes).  Add in the rice and salt and stir well, stir like you mean it. Then add in the water and stir, bringing the mixture to a simmer.  Cover and boil for about 45 minutes, stirring throughout.</li>
<li>While the rice is cooking, marinate those salmon steaks. Place the first 7 ingredients from the salmon section of the recipe in a plastic bag or baking dish and toss salmon steaks&#8230;sufficiently coating each one.  Seal the bag or cover the baking dish and let marinade for up to 30 minutes in the fridge, turning pretty frequently so they soak up the maximum amount of glaze!</li>
<li>When the water from the rice is sufficiently evaporated, turn off the heat, let stand 5 minutes, and fluff with a fork.  Stir in juice from 1/2 a lime and 1/4 cup cilantro.  The rice will still be relatively sticky so don&#8217;t look all surprised when it comes out wetter than something like Basmati rice. Basmati is old school, baby.</li>
<li>When the salmon is marinated, whip out a frying pan.  Throw in some some olive oil or cooking spray and heat up to medium.  Drop the salmon steaks in and cook thoroughly on each side. Unless you&#8217;re into the whole raw fish thing, which is great, except that this salmon is not sushi grade and therefore I do not recommend indulging in your inner grizzly bear. Should take about 5 minutes of cooking on each side&#8230;you will see the really pink middle turn opaque when done.</li>
<li>While you&#8217;ve got this goin&#8217; on, chop up all the fruit from the fruit relish part of the ingredient list.  Stir in the orange juice and cilantro.  I would really recommend fresh squeezed OJ, however snobby that sounds. It&#8217;s flavor is so refreshing and tart over the standard taste of the orange juice in a box. But I digress&#8230;.</li>
<li>Top the salmon with the fruit and pair it with the rice. Not only does your plate look like the rainbow, the way it tastes is sure to win over every salmon-skeptic. You&#8217;re welcome.</li>

Breakfast? Dessert? Fuel for a long hike? Check, check, aaaaand check.<br><br>
These bad boys are salty, sweet, chewy (hence the title&#8230;) triple threats. I really love a dessert that&#8217;s healthy enough to be a breakfast. This also reverses. I really love a breakfast that doubles as dessert. Ice cream excluded.<br><br>
Maybe.<br><br>
Moving on.<br><br>
Have you ever opened up a wrapper from what you thought was a healthy power bar and tried to pronounce the ingredient list? It&#8217;s like listing the chemicals you&#8217;ll be using in a science experiment.  Me and my bod aren&#8217;t feelin it. We&#8217;re cool off that.<br><br>
In granola&#8217;s defense, there are lots of brands now, like Larabar, that have only a few simple and actually pronounceable ingredients. What a concept?! But how about taking it a step further and making your own? These granola bars are concocted with tons of brown rice and oatmeal to fuel your exercise, nuts to keep you feeling satiated, and dried fruit and honey to tickle your tastebuds pink. They are vegan, gluten free, and sweetened only with honey. Although the recipe may look seemingly convoluted, fear not, hippy, the nuts and fruits in these groovy granola bars can easily be swapped for whatever you have on hand. Although nothing beats the combo below, I have found. These are by far, the best granola bars I have ever had.  The texture, the flavor, just&#8230;everything. I&#8217;m over here like, &#8220;granola bars, are you made out of beaver?&#8221;<br><br>
I&#8217;m leaving in a couple days for a week of hiking with my brother.  I will be void of phone and computer and I cannot wait.<span style="font-size: 16px;"> Along with trail mix, those semi-tasty semi-weird light weight freeze dried meals you buy for way too much money at REI, and lots of fruit, these granola bars are coming with me in my pack.  Which I am trying, desperately, to keep under 30 pounds. My brother has warned me to bring only what I need. We really need the Coleman dual fuel lantern and the flamingo tent pegs right?<br><br>
Hashtag packrat.<br><br>
Take these granola bars hiking. Take them on a long bike ride. Take them on a mountain climb.
<br><br>
Or enjoy while watching Netflix in your underwear.  The choice, my friend, is yours.

<h2>Makes about 20 cookies, ~120 calories per cookie</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>1.5 cups old fashioned rolled oats</li>
<li>1 cup raw sunflower seeds</li>
<li>1 cup raw almonds</li>
<li>1 cup raw pumpkin seeds</li>
<li>3 cups brown rice crispies</li>
<li>1 cup dried cranberries</li>
<li>1 cup dried apricots</li>
<li>1 cup almond butter</li>
<li>1 cup honey</li>
<li>1 1/4 T sea salt</li>
<li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>

</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Heat oven to 350 or turn on the toaster. Chop the almonds and toast them.  Watch them carefully and stir them frequently, they go from perfectly toasty to burnt in a matter of seconds. You want them to be brown and give off a roasted aroma. Next toast the oats, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds.  Woah woah woah Mr. Multitasker, slow your roll. You have to toast them separately because they all have different burn times. I learned this the hard way&#8230;</li>
<li>Slice and dice the apricots into small chunks.  When all items are sufficiently toasted, toss them in a bowl with the rice crispies, dried cranberries, and sliced apricots.</li>
<li>In a small saucepan, heat the almond butter and honey.  You want to heat up the mixture until it gets all melty.  Don&#8217;t let it boil or even come close to boiling- this is your granola bar &#8220;glue.&#8221; Good news for the kids who used to eat paste in kindergarden. Stir in the salt and cinnamon.</li>
<li>Slowly pour this over the nut mixture and stir until evenly incorporated, being careful not to crush the crispies. We need them to uh, stay crispy, after all.</li>
<li>Pour the whole mixture into a 9&#215;13&#8243; glass baking pan lined with parchment paper or whatever pan or dish you fancy. Press down evenly and firmly, again being careful to not crush those little crispies. Cover and refrigerate for 3-4 hours.  When ready, cut into 2&#8243; squares and wrap individually.</li>

<h1>Spicy Indian Veggie Burgers</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/spicyindianveggieburgers.png"></p>



<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">

	Behold&#8230;the magic, the mystery, the complete and absolute marvelousness! I have been scouring the earth (and by earth I mean online recipe database&#8230;) far and wide for literally a year and a half for an easy veggie burger recipe that doesn&#8217;t make your tastebuds shrivel in repugnance.<br><br>
	I have tried an endless amount of different combinations; quinoa and black bean, white bean and spinach, a variety of expensive nuts&#8230;and not one&#8230;ONE, I tell you, has tasted like anything but spiced up snippets of cardboard.  I wasn&#8217;t too hopeful about taking yet another stab at the whole vegan burger brigade, but I am beyond thrilled that I did.<br><br>
	Chickpeas and lentils form the base, while a mix of seasonings like cumin and chili pepper give them their Indian-spice feel. They are a tiny bit spicy, so if you are <del>a wimp</del><span style="color: #ff9900;"> <span style="color: #000000;"> not into heat, take out some of the chili peppers and jalapenos. </span> </span>Also duly noted, these vegan and gluten free babies actually hold together just like their meaty equivalents!  This means we can cook them in the pan without fearing for their survival post-pan-flip.  What a concept, right?  Mind= blown.<br><br>
	These are fantastic for quick make-ahead lunches and dinners.  Or breakfasts if you&#8217;re a total weirdo (Hi, right there with you) and just reallllllly fancy these veggie burgers. Make them now, eat as many as humanly possible, then wrap the rest in tin foil and freeze.  Absolutely perfect on a toasted bun with hummus, tahini, or avocado. Perhaps all 3 if you&#8217;re feelin&#8217; fine n&#8217; fancy. Get some.

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 cup dried red or green lentils, cooked according to package</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 15-oz can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 garlic cloves</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 red onion diced finely</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped finely</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 red bell pepper, finely diced</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 large carrot, grated</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/4 cup oat bran or oat flour..perhaps a little more (you can make this by simply putting rolled oats into a blender or food processor)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 tsp ground cumin</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 tsp garlic salt</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 tsp chili powder</li></ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Place chickpeas, lentils, garlic, and spices into a food processor and blend until the beans are very smooth.  If you don&#8217;t own a food processor, don&#8217;t worry.  Just smash the smithereens out of them until they become a paste.  Warning: this may require muscular arms&#8230;.</li>
<li>Transfer the mixture into a large bowl.  Stir in the red pepper, onion, jalapeno, and carrot.  Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary.  Add in the oat flour slowly&#8230;use only as much as you need so that the burgers bind together and don&#8217;t fall apart.  You don&#8217;t want them to be droopy gooey hot messes but you don&#8217;t want a bunch of crumbly patties either.  Strike a balance here. Form them into normal sized patties.</li>
<li>Heat a skillet over medium heat&#8230;make sure it&#8217;s non stick!  Spray the pan with olive/canola oil before you drop each burger in and, if needed, in between while flipping them.  Place a couple burgers in at a time and brown each side. Repeat until all the patties are done.  Stick &#8217;em between burger buns or even lettuce rolls or on top of a fresh salad.  Some ahhhmazing toppings are hummus, guac/avocado, tahini, tomatoes, and duh&#8230;mustard&amp;ketchup.</li>
<li>These make about 9 burgers depending on how hideously ginormous or pathetically teeny you make them&#8230;wrap them individually in foil and freeze if you want to keep them around longer.  They will last for several months before tasting the way the back of the freezer smells.</li>

<h1>Spicy Coconut Red Curry</h1>

<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/spicycoconutredcurry.png"></p>



<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">


	It was an unassuming restaurant.  Neither littered with elaborate decor nor teeming with fancily-clad waiters wearing bow ties.<br><br>
	Okay, okay fine, it was a bar.  And we stopped in for a quick bite to eat and a brew.  Now, this place was an all American joint&#8230;burgers, fries, the whole shebang.   The only thing on the menu sans meat was a random red curry and rice dish.  Seeing as how my options were limited and my stomach was beginning to growl something fierce, I began to order the probably Americanized, bland, and doubtfully tasty dish.  My waitress stopped me mid sentence and began to gush about how delicious it was, about how it was her favorite thing on the menu. I raised an eyebrow but seeing as how it was the only thing I could eat, I went ahead and ordered it!<br><br>
	>I have this strange aversion to ordering dishes that are from one culture at a place that boasts a menu of a different culture.  I don&#8217;t know why&#8230;I just feel that it can&#8217;t be done as well.  Take for instance, when you see a burger on the menu of a chinese restaurant.  Stick to what you know.  With this mentality, I went to take my first bite of the curry dish and was overwhelmed with surprise.  It had hints of coconut, and lemongrass, and paired so well with the rice nestled underneath it.  Who&#8217;da thunk?  I took half home and devoured the rest for lunch the next day.<br><br>
	I usually order mushroom mutter (matar..mattar&#8230;? someone help a sistah out here) or chana masala at an Indian restaurant.  The chana masala includes chickpeas simmered in tomatoes and the mutter is green peas and mushrooms in a creamy sauce.  When eating Thai, I love the spicy red curries over rice.  Being the culinary dare devil that I am, I set out to marry the two.  Thai food&#8230;welcome, welcome! And in the words of Alanis Morissette, thank you India.<br><br>
	If you&#8217;re not a fan of spice, I would probably recommend that you seek a recipe elsewhere or retreat to the playground swings where you belong.  Just kidding. But in all seriousness, I love spicy food.  I even sprinkled on red pepper flakes after the fact because apparently I was a dragon in a previous life and would like to again try to breathe fire.  The coconut milk adds an element of creamy sweetness to this dish and it is (of course) jam packed with tons of fresh veggies.  The chickpeas are optional but I added them in for extra protein!<br><br>
	I would start on the rice before anything else.  Thai Kitchen makes a great red curry paste and this paste can be found in just about any grocery store (Note: Trader Joe&#8217;s is slackin&#8217; and does not carry it).  I would also recommend using full-fat coconut milk.  Don&#8217;t worry, this isn&#8217;t the same fat dripping off of your Krispy Kreme.  All Trader Joe&#8217;s had was low fat so I used that and wished I would have taken the extra 10 steps across the street to purchase the other version. What can I say, it was raining and my hair was already looking like Mufasa&#8217;s mane.

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>1 small head of cauliflower</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
<li>1 cup frozen green peas</li>
<li>1/2 onion</li>
<li>1 T olive oil</li>
<li>1 cup mushrooms (I used cremini)</li>
<li>1 14-oz can coconut milk</li>
<li>2 T red curry paste</li>
<li>2 T brown sugar</li>
<li>2 T soy sauce or tamari if gluten free</li>
<li>1 15-oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed (optional)</li>
<li>1 cup brown rice (or white)</li></ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Start by cooking the rice.  Combine in a large pot (or just use a rice cooker) 1 cup rice with 2 cups of water.  Bring to a boil and then cover and simmer for about 40 minutes, or until all of the water is absorbed.  Set aside, still covered, for about 10 minutes and then fluff with a fork.</li>
<li>While the rice is bubblin&#8217; start another pot full of boiling water.  Cut the cauliflower head into slightly larger than bite sized florets, about 3 cups worth.  Blanch the cauliflower. Blanching? What the S#$*?! Fear not!  It&#8217;s just one way to partially cook something and simply means boiling the florets in the water with a little salt for about 3-4 minutes.  Then run the florets under cold water until completely cooled. Pat dry and set aside.</li>
<li>Chop the onion into bite sized pieces and thinly slice the shrooms.</li>
<li>Add the olive oil to a skillet and saute the onion and mushrooms for 5-7 minutes, until brown and tender.</li>
<li>In a wide saucepan over medium heat, mix together the coconut milk, curry paste, sugar, and soy sauce/tamari along with the water.</li>
<li>Add in the cauliflower, mushrooms, onion, frozen peas, and if feeling turned on by the thought of oligosaccharides, the chickpeas.</li>
<li>Simmer for 10-15 minutes, throw some red pepper flakes on top if you&#8217;re seeking a dinner/nasal decongestant all rolled into one, and serve over hot brown rice. Enjoy this tasty multi cultural union.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">

I got super-nerdy-food-blogger excited when I heard that Sarah Britton from <a href="http://www.mynewroots.org/site/" target="_blank">My New Roots</a> was going to be in LA promoting her new cookbook. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with her blog, y&#8217;all betta get acquainted because not only is she an incredibly innovative chef, but someone whose writing skills I greatly admire.<br><br>
>I was doing a garden build class in North Hollywood at the time but rushed over to a small natural juice shop (like, how LA, right?) to be first in line. She was so sweet and even though I warned her of my gardening in the hot sun stink, she laughed and gave me a hug anyway. I got a free signed copy of her book and lemme tell ya, it is amazing.<br><br>
Also, my friend was looking at her blog a couple days later and discovered that my greasy hair and right thigh are now internet famous. Should I hire a personal assistant and start demanding only red M&amp;M&#8217;s in my bowl now or later?<br><br>
But back to the recipe. Ugh, I had way too much fun playing with the flavors in this cake.  Once I hit the store to look at what they had in the produce section and started thinking of things that could pair with rhubarb, I couldn&#8217;t stop. If you peruse rhubarb-recipes, you&#8217;ll see strawberry this and strawberry that.  A stunning combo, yes, but I really wanted to do something more unique.<br><br>
Here is a moist cake with a melty gooey consistency that you would expect in a traditional dulce de leche cake.  Instead of strawberries, honey roasted rhubarb is combined with the juice and zest of a whole fresh orange, then mixed with mouth watering white chocolate, and finally slathered with rich creamy coconut milk.<br><br>
Yes, just all the yes&#8217;s.<br><br>
Rhubarb is a excellenttttt source of Vitamin K and its tart flavor lends well to the richness of the healthy fat in the coconut. The brown sugar topping is optional, but highly recommended to counter the zippy sour of the rhubarb. And don&#8217;t skip the lathering of coconut milk at the end, it really takes the cake from mmmm to MMMMM. This is one of my favorite cakes to date, mostly because it&#8217;s not your typical crumbly cake&#8230;it&#8217;s soft and gushy and full of summer flavors.

This cake is very moist on the inside, so don&#8217;t expect anything dry or crumbly.</li>
<li>Let cool for at least 15 minutes! To get the cake out, scrape around the sides with a knife and then invert on a plate.</li>

Happy St. Patrick&#8217;s Day! Here is a green dish that does not involve corned beef, cabbage, or anything Irish for that matter.  But hey, it&#8217;s still green!  Eat this and you won&#8217;t get pinched!<br><br>
There&#8217;s a saying in my house, &#8220;once you start cooking spaghetti squash, ya don&#8217;t look back.&#8221;<br><br>
Alright, so I completely made that up. Totally BS. But still, if there WERE a saying in my house, it might be that one. Who knew that you could create spaghetti from a squash? The first time I tried it I felt like how jesus must have felt when he turned water into wine. If only I could turn squash into wine&#8230;.hmm&#8230;more pondering shall be done on that later.<br><br>
This is great news for all my gluten-free people, but even you gluttonous gluten-devourers (you know who you are&#8230;and I&#8217;m looking in the mirror with a guilty look on my face and a feeling of shame) can appreciate this recipe.  It&#8217;s simple and so delicious.  Honestly, the most difficult part is getting the stupid squash open.  Normally for me this requires hacking the thing in half with a large knife while whoever is within a 20 foot radius of me gasps in horror and prays for my safety.  It can be difficult as spaghetti squashes are rather large and pretty thick, but with several swift stabs and a nice set of muscles on your arms (just kidding, if I can do it, you can do it!) it can be pried open in a few minutes.<br><br>
Most pesto recipes use parmesan cheese, but the vegan part of this recipe comes from the fact that the cheese is replaced by nutritional yeast.  Don&#8217;t be scared by the name! I promise it is not vegan alien food. It hails from the earth and it&#8217;s delicious. It&#8217;s packed with vitamin B, zinc, folic acid, selenium, and even protein! It packs a punch of flavor that most describe as cheesy and nutty&#8230;many people actually put it on their popcorn.  I absolutely LOVE cooking with this stuff, it&#8217;s sold as a powder and you can find it in the bulk section of your grocery store. Now, where were we? Ah, yes, spaghetti.  Spaghetti with pesto. Yessssss, of course. Luck of the Irish&#8230;er&#8230;.Italian..

<hr>



<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>1 spaghetti squash (large yellow &amp; oval)</li>
<li>8 T olive oil</li>
<li>salt/pepper</li>
<li>3 cups fresh basil, loosely packed</li>
<li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
<li>6 T pine nuts or walnuts</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast</li></ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol><li>Start by cooking up that beast of a squash. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees</li>
<li>Split the spaghetti squash in half with a large, slightly terrifying knife.  Scrape out the seeds and place each half, cut side up, on a baking dish.  Drizzle each half&#8217;s inside flesh with 2 T olive oil and a shake of salt and pepper.  Cook for 30-50 minutes depending on the size of the squash, just keep checking periodically. They are done when you can easily pierce the inside and drag a fork through the yellow part creating spaghetti-like strands all the way down to the rind.</li>
<li>When it&#8217;s ready, fork out as much of the spaghetti strands as you can into a bowl and set aside.</li>
<li>To make the pesto, put the nuts, basil, 1 tsp of salt, and garlic into a food processor until finely ground.</li>
<li>Add remaining 6 T of olive oil to the pesto, then the nutritional yeast, and process until smooth and creamy.</li>
<li>Combine &#8216;spaghetti&#8217; and pesto sauce.  If you fancy a lot of sauce, I would double the sauce recipe.  Noms.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
	Someone brought it up to me the other day that my blog, The Savvy Sweet Potato, is thus far lacking any recipes containing sweet potato.  Uhh&#8230;what? Really? Completely shocked and utterly embarrassed, I figured I should remedy this situation with a recipe for brownies. Redemption at its sweetest:<br><br>
	High in iron, B vitamins, magnesium, and carotenoids (cancer fighters/immune boosters), sweet potatoes, if you couldn&#8217;t already guess, are my absolute favorite vegetable.  This proclamation is huge, because I happen to love all vegetables on planet earth. Sweet potatoes take the cake though (or&#8230;brownie&#8230;.see what I did there?) because they are just so versatile.  For instance, you can turn them into delicious fudgey brownies! I am not pullin your leg here. Read on.<br><br>
	I have made this recipe several times with pretty good reviews from friends.  But, this time, I tweaked the recipe a bit and these brownies jumped from good to out of this world amazing.  They are made with such a simple list of delicious, nutritious ingredients that when I went to eat one (or three&#8230;.) for dessert, I actually felt really energized and awake. This led me to the justification that I could eat one for breakfast&#8230;but moving on&#8230;<br><br>
	The real game changer was toasting the almonds before I ground them and adding in cacao nibs.  What in the hell are <a title="cacao nibs" href="http://www.vitacost.com/navitas-naturals-cacao-nibs" target="_blank">cacao nibs</a>, you ask?  Good question. They&#8217;re like the OG chocolate&#8230;basically they are just whole natural cocoa beans that have been mechanically split.  They are quite bitter on their own, but impart a rich chocolatey crunch when paired with something a little sweeter. They are packed full of anti oxidants, which is the reason any fashion magazine you read will tell you to eat a little chocolate now and again, it&#8217;s healthy for you. However, these little guys are only found in health food stores and can get pricey, so if you would like to make a switch-a-roo, I suggest adding in dark chocolate chips (preferably mini) and taking out the maple syrup. Toasting the almonds adds a layer of rich nutty smokey flavor and is a necessary step, in my humble opinion.<br><br>
	Completely dairy, sugar, and gluten free, creamy sweet potatoes and caramel-like dates form the bulk of these delicious fudgey brownies.

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>2 medium sized sweet potatoes</li>
<li>1 cup almonds</li>
<li>1/2 cup buckwheat or brown rice flour</li>
<li>14 medjool dates</li>
<li>4 T cocoa powder or raw cacao</li>
<li>3 T pure maple syrup (omit if using chocolate chips instead of cacao nibs)</li>
<li>pinch of sea salt</li>
<li>1/2 cup cacao nibs (or dark chocolate chips&#8230;nibs highly recommended)
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Start by toasting up them almonds.  Place on a baking sheet and toast in the oven at 350 degrees or put in toaster oven until browned and begin to omit a toasted aroma.  Stir frequently&#8230;careful not to burn!</li>
<li>Once toasted up, put almonds food processor and grind until they become almost powdered. Set aside.</li>
<li>Peel and dice the 2 sweet potatoes, then steam for about 20 minutes (they are done when you can poke them with a fork and they&#8217;re mushy) then add to food processor</li>
<li>While the taters are steaming, the dates need to be softened.  Place the dates in a bowl of hot water (so water covers all dates) to soak for about 15 minutes, or if lazy like myself, place in bowl of water and microwave for 2-3 minutes.  Take out the pits and add to food processor.  Process dates/sweet potato mixture until crrrrreamy as possible</li>
<li>Mix in bowl with ground almonds and remaining ingredients</li>
<li>Grease a square baking dish with olive or coconut oil (or simply line with parchment paper) and spread batter into pan</li>
<li>Sprinkle brownies with a little cocoa powder and bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  Brownies are done when pierced with a fork and the fork comes out dry.</li>
<li>Let brownies cool at least 10 minutes before cutting.  I know this is complete torture, but I promise its a necessity so they have a chance to set. Do as I say and not what I do- be patient.</li>
<li>Pair brownies with a big glass of milk (or soymilk&#8230;.or almond milk&#8230;.) and eat yo little sweet potato loving heart out.</li>

<h1>Raspberry Crumb Squares</h1>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">

	When I was just a wee one in elementary school, as I watched all the other kids at lunch peel away the plastic and devour their delicious processed Lunchables, I sat in the corner and unwrapped a soggy tuna sandwich.  Every. Single. Day.  The whole wheat bread would shake hands and mingle with the mayo-ridden tuna fish and it would shape shift into this ball of mush rolled into tin foil that would stink up my entire lunch box.  Although only mildly scarred from the whole experience&#8230;I was always green with envy as I saw my classmates eating the square pepperoni pizzas that the cafeterias served.  Now that I&#8217;m older and wiser (sort of), I feel forever indebted to my mother.<br><br>
	She instilled in me that home cooking is healthier cooking, and I have never forgotten that simple truth.<br><br>
	&#8230;.My poor future children.  Not only will they have long scraggly hair that I will refuse to cut and be forced to take drum, guitar, AND piano lessons, but they too will be munching on soggy sandwiches at lunch.  What goes around comes around, kay?<br><br>
	Don&#8217;t feel too bad for them, look at this dessert that they&#8217;ll potentially be eating.  That&#8217;s right. They&#8217;ll be long-haired, musically talented, AND <del>obese</del> well fed.<br><br>
	I win.<br><br>
	I am very excited to share this recipe with you because my mom is the one who introduced me to it!  She is so sweet; when I first switched my diet several years ago she took a recipe and modified it to make it vegan for my 22nd birthday.  I have taken it a step further to make it gluten free as well!  It&#8217;s sweet, crunchy, and oozing with rich bright raspberry jam.  Plus, adding nuts (optional) to the recipe will amp up the protein value!<br><br>
	The most difficult part of this recipe is letting it cool before cutting it!  You really have to wait it out because otherwise it will just be one big gooey mess, which, let&#8217;s face it, isn&#8217;t a terrible thing as long as it tastes good, but if you&#8217;re going for bars you have to let them cool completely.  Check your facebook, stalk your ex on instagram, pick your nose, do whatever for the next 30-45 minutes because these babies need ample time to set.<br><br>
	This dish also works well if you want to pour it over ice cream while it&#8217;s still hot. You can sub the gluten free flour for all purpose flour&#8230;whole wheat pastry flour may work as well.  You can also try using chia instead of flax seed but as chia tends to not assimilate as well, it could throw off the texture.  Who knows&#8230;experiment!

<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>1  1/4 cups gluten-free all purpose flour (or all purpose flour&#8230;I have not tried whole wheat but you could definitely give it your best effort!)</li>
<li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
<li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
<li>1/4 salt</li>
<li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup coconut oil, plus a little more for greasing the baking pan with</li>
<li>1 T ground flax seed + 3 T water + another 1/2 tsp ground flax seed</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>1/2 tsp almond extract</li>
<li>2 cups old fashioned rolled oats (gluten free if necessary)</li>
<li>1 cup raspberry jam (you could also try apricot/strawberry/blackberry)</li></ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and grease a 9-in square baking dish with some coconut oil.</li>
<li>Sift the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, 1/2 tsp ground flax seed, and salt together in a bowl.  Set aside.</li>
<li>In another small bowl, mix together 1 T ground flax seed and 3 T water.  Let sit for at least 5 minutes until mixture becomes a little gooey.</li>
<li>Cream together the brown sugar and coconut oil in a separate bowl or electric mixer.  If the coconut oil is pretty much a solid, heat it up in the microwave for a bit until it becomes softer&#8230;you want it to be just like the consistency of butter/margarine.  Work with me here, we&#8217;re trying to avoid clogging up your arteries.</li>
<li>Beat the flax and water mixture, along with the vanilla and almond extracts, into the sugar and oil.  Then add in the flour mixture and stir until smooth.</li>
<li>Stir in 1 3/4 cup of the oats and mix well.</li>
<li>Spread 2/3 of this batter into the bottom of the greased pan.</li>
<li>Spread the jam onto the top with a spatula or the back of the spoon.  See, spooning is always a good time.</li>
<li>Now add the rest of the oats (should be about 1/4 cup) into the rest of the batter and stir until thoroughly combined.  Crumble this over the jam and place in the oven for about 35 minutes.</li>
<li>Take pan out of oven, annnnnnd LET IT COOL!  Wait at least 30-45 minutes.</li>
<li>When completely cooled, cut into squares.  Warning, these squares will be a little flimsy but I promise the taste is out of this universe. If lazy or impatient or both, you can always spoon the mixture while its warm over some dairy free (I like coconut milk or cashew cream) ice cream. Much yum.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
There is little in life that cannot be solved by a bowl of pink ice cream.<br><br>
And if there is, I don&#8217;t want that kind of stress in my life.<br><br>
Spring break (wow, saying that feels like I&#8217;m back in my boozy college frat-party-hopping days&#8230;) was awesome and simply not long enough.  It was theeeee perfect combination of thrilling adventure, absolute fun, and lazy as hell relaxation. I backpacked through Joshua Tree, BBQ&#8217;d by the pool with friends, and cooked a bunch of shtuff with my Pops. Definitely not ready to be back yet, but still trying to hang on to the dream and ride the leisure wave a little bit longer.<br><br>
This ice cream is decadent, pretty, and despite it being a sweet frozen treat, is actually very good for you.  After all, it has only <em>three</em> completely natural ingredients and is totally sugar free.<br><br>
Even if you&#8217;re not in the midst of Spring Break and are currently pouring a 4th cup of coffee while struggling to get dressed without putting your underwear on backwards, consider making this frozen yummy this weekend to unwind.<br><br>
Close your eyes and imagine yourself being fanned by an enormous palm leaf.<br><br>
We can all pretend, right?

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
Cupcakes baked in ice cream cones are even <em>more</em> fun.  Notice I did not say &#8220;funner.&#8221;  I had the strong urge to, but I have been given so much grief about that word by my friend who was an English major that even the mere thought of it strikes fear into my muffin tins.<br><br>
But I digress, these cupcakes are sweet, tasty, spongy, light, and aren&#8217;t they just the cutest things you have EVER seen?  Besides Penny Lane, of course.<br><br>
I wanted to make something special for a friend&#8217;s birthday.  As it turns out, transporting 18 cupcake cones ready to topple over in a rickety ice chest down a slippery path to the beach is not a task for the faint of heart.  Nevertheless, they survived (if only partially) and made it to the mouths of some hungry beach campers.<br><br>
These sweet scrumptious treats are made with fresh, plump, pureed peaches kissed by the summer sun.<br><br>And topped with a vegan buttercream and honey frosting.  Then baked to perfection in crunchy ice cream cones.<br><br>
Sprinkles optional, but HIGHLY recommended.<br><br>
Come on, it&#8217;s summer, bring on the kiddie self-indulgences.

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<p style="text-align: center;">For the cupcakes:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 cup non dairy milk</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp apple cider vinegar (you can also sub red wine/champagne/sherry vinegar)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 fresh ripe peaches</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/3 cup olive oil or melted coconut oil</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 1/4 cup all purpose flour (you can sub half the flour for whole wheat, but FYI they won&#8217;t rise as nicely)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3/4 tsp baking soda</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">pinch of salt</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">about 12 ice cream cones (cake variety)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>First get that oven nice and toasty, pre heat to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>Add the vinegar to the non dairy milk, stir briskly, and let it sit for a few minutes and curdle.</li>
<li>Next add the sugar, oil, and vanilla to the milk and vinegar mixture.  Beat until foamy.  (If you are using melted coconut oil instead of olive oil, make sure the milk isn&#8217;t too cold or the coconut oil will solidify!:)</li>
<li>To prepare the peaches, peel them, remove the pit, and slice.  If you have a food processor, pulse until pureed.  If you are lacking in the food processor department, it might be okay to place the peach slices in a little bowl and heat them for 30 seconds and then mash the crap out of them&#8230;) Whatever you do, jedi peach master, make sure those babies are nice and smooth.  Add the peaches to the liquid mixture and beat until smooth.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.  Add the flour in slowly, beating in between until smooth and creamy.</li>
<li>Line a muffin tin with ice cream cones and fill each cone almost to the top with batter using a small spoon.</li>
<li>Bake for about 25 minutes, checking at 20 minutes and sticking a fork in one cupcake.  If the fork comes out clean, the cupcakes are done!  Makes about 10 or 12 ice cream cone cupcakes.</li>
<li>Let cool completely and then frost and sprinkle each cupcake!  Frosting recipe provided below.   *Note: These can also be made as standard cupcakes.  Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners and pour/spoon the batter into the cups about 3/4 of the way full!</li>

</ol>

<div id = "ingredients">
<p style="text-align: center;">For the Honey Buttercream Frosting:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>1/2 cup non dairy butter, at room temperature (i.e. Earth Balance)</li>
<li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 T non dairy milk</li>
<li>4 T honey or agave nectar</li>
<li>Rainbow sprinkles!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>While the cupcakes are in the oven, whip up the frosting!  Begin by creaming together and powdered sugar and honey or agave.</li>
<li>Add 1 cup of the powdered sugar and blend until creamy. (about 2 minutes)</li>
<li>Add the other cup of the powdered sugar and blend until creamy. (about 2 more minutes)</li>
<li>Add non dairy milk and blend again.  Check consistency.  If it&#8217;s too runny, add more sugar.  If it&#8217;s too thick and paste-like, add more milk.  But add these in little by little until the frosting is the perfect thickness!  Refrigerate until the cupcakes are ready to be frosted.</li>

<h1>PB&J Thumbprint Cookies</h1>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
Who needs friends&#8230;<br><br>
When you have cookies?<br><br>
I mean I guess it&#8217;s nice to get basic human social interaction and all, but these cookies have peanut butter in them&#8230;<br><br>
So&#8230;there&#8217;s that.<br><br>
Anywho, a very crafty friend of mine gave me a jar of homemade prickly pear jam a couple months ago.  YUM!  But, it sat in my fridge.  I was stumped.  I didn&#8217;t know what to make with it or how to eat it (besides the obvious route via spoonfuls in mouth).  I really wanted a peanut butter and jelly cookie, but I wanted to make them a bit healthier, so these are made using a secret ingredient&#8230;<br><br>
If you don&#8217;t tell people that they&#8217;re made out of chickpeas&#8230;they will never know.<br><br>
These cookies are as beautiful as they are tasty; the rich peanut butter and the hearty oats are the perfect accompaniment to that saweeeeeeet jelly filling.  I made half of them with pumpkin butter instead of the jam and those, too, disappeared from the plate almost instantly.  BAI.<br><br>
Make these with any kind of jelly you have on hand&#8230;or try apple/pumpkin butter and let me know what strikes your PB&amp;J fancy&#8230;also make sure to crank up your most irritating christmas music (think Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Feliz Navidad) and start getting in that holiday spirit.

<h2>Makes about 16 cookies, ~125 cals each</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 15 oz can of chickpeas (same thing as garbanzo beans&#8230;DUH)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 cup peanut butter (can also use almond butter)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1  3/4 + 1/4 cups old fashioned rolled oats, separated</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 T soymilk (or other non dairy milk)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp baking powder</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 cup jam (raspberry, strawberry, grape&#8230;or pumpkin/apple/other kind of fruit butter)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Crank up oven to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>Get out that handy dandy food processor.  You&#8217;re gonna need it!  Combine the chickpeas, peanut butter, 1/4 cup of the oats, sugar, soymilk, and baking powder in the food processor and process until a smooth dough forms. Soooo labor intensive, I know.</li>
<li>Transfer dough to a medium sized bowl and add in the remaining oats (1  3/4 cup).  Mix in the oats until the dough becomes more solid and less sticky.</li>
<li>Grease a cookie sheet and shape the dough into individual balls.  This dough will definitely stick to your fingers no matter what, so you&#8217;ll probably have to wash them a couple times throughout the process or the cookies will lose their shape and become uglier and uglier. I licked my fingers in lieu of hand washing. Mind your own business, this is my kitchen.</li>
<li>Bake for 15-17 minutes, or until cookies become firm and a soft golden brown color.  Keep checking them so they don&#8217;t burn. Let cool before eating.  These are really good straight out of the freezer, too, so if you can&#8217;t gobble them all up at one time, let them chillskeez, enjoy them later, and they will not disappoint.</li>

<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/macaroonchocolatedrops.png"></p>



<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">This Christmas, one of the slightly depressing side effects of being a grad student is my lack of funds for gift giving.<br><br>
If you took a peek into my scraggly wallet from Marshalls, I am about 99.9% positive you would find anywhere from 6 to 7 cobwebs.<br><br>
SO. Consequently, I am giving hugs as presents this year.<br><br>
I&#8217;m like &#8220;YOU GET A HUG!&#8221; &#8220;YOU GET A HUG!&#8221; &#8220;EVERYONE GETS HUGS!&#8221;<br><br>
I kid I kid, I know I can&#8217;t feel too bad about the whole thing because I decided to just make my gifts this year.  And these gifts come in the form of dark chocolate coconut truffles. Yanno&#8230;to uh, serve as accompaniments alongside my warm fuzzy hugs&#8230;<br><br>
These chocolate drops are sinfully good. They&#8217;re made with rich dark chocolate, creamy coconut, fresh spring blossom honey, and a hint of sea salt.  Additionally, you can get all artsy-fartsy-Martha-Stewart-Pinteresty and roll them in toasted walnuts, crushed candy cane, cocoa powder, or shredded coconut.  I wrapped them up in cute little glass jars with holiday-themed ribbon and tags with every intention to give them away as gifts.  Yet, when the time came to relinquish one to my mother, it was as if I had morphed into Smeagol from Lord of the Rings&#8230;she almost had to pry the jar from my chocolatey-stained fingers and the only words that could escape my lips were, &#8220;my precious&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>
The best part about these tiny tasty little guys? NO BAKING REQUIRED. Chocolate lovahs, rejoice. When they&#8217;re done, stick &#8217;em in the refrigerator.

<h2>Makes about 40 medium size truffles, ~100 calories each</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 cups dark chocolate chips</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">4 T honey (can also use agave nectar or pure Maple Syrup)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3/4 cup coconut cream (can also use the creamy top of a can of full-fat coconut milk)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp vanilla</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">cocoa powder, shredded coconut, crushed candy cane, or toasted walnuts for rolling</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>If you&#8217;re using nuts to roll some of your drops in (why did that sound soo wrong?) then you&#8217;re going to want to toast them first. Spread out about 3/4 cup raw walnuts on a piece of foil and place in the toaster on medium heat for about 3-4 minutes! You can also toast them in the oven on a cookie sheet at about 400 degrees. Keep checking them and stirring until they begin to take on a light brown color and left off a toasted aroma.  They can burn in an instant, so as soon as they begin to change color, they&#8217;re probz done.</li>
<li>Back to the macaroon chocolate drops, grab a medium sized saucepan, place it on the stove, and pour all the chocolate chips in it over a very low setting.  Keep stirring until all the chocolate is melted and gooey.</li>
<li>Stir in the coconut cream and whisk until all the lumps are gone.</li>
<li>Add in the honey, cinnamon, salt, and va-va-vanilla.  Stir until a creamy consistency.</li>
<li>When it&#8217;s nice and smooth, pour into a bowl and place in the freezer for 45 minutes.  Then stir with a spoon and transfer the bowl to the fridge.  This &#8220;dough&#8221; can sit there overnight but if you&#8217;re as impatient as I am (there is chocolate involved here, people) then it should be good to go in about 2-3 hours. I know, I know&#8230;still an excruciatingly long time to wait&#8230;I fully condone eating spoonfuls as &#8220;testers&#8221; while it&#8217;s firming up.</li>
<li>Roll the dough into small lil balls and then pick whatever you want your chocolatey truffles to be rolled in.  I used shredded coconut, toasted walnuts, crushed candy canes, and cocoa powder.  *HINT* Cocoa powder is by the far the easiest one to roll the truffles in.  But hell, it&#8217;s the holidays; go to town&#8230;try mini chocolate chips or minced up marshmallows. Store these in the fridge!  They should keep for at least a couple weeks.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">

	Rich chewy chocolate peanut butter cookies sprinkled with a hint of sea salt and bursting with creamy peanut butter cups when you bite in.<br><br>
	These cookies can send you to rehab.<br><br>
	They are seriously addictive; I&#8217;ve seen three of my friends succumb to shaking and crying when I told them there were no more left.<br><br>
	Move over, Amy Winehouse. We&#8217;re comin for ya.<br><br>
	Too soon??<br><br>
	My bad, my bad.<br><br>
	Just trying to prove a point, here. And ultimately that point is that these cookies are dairy-free and gluten-free and some of the best cookies I&#8217;ve made to date. The sea salt sprinkled on top is really the icing on the sundae, I mean the cherry on the cake. I mean.<br><br>
	Woof, Can&#8217;t think. Consuming too many cookies, too quickly. Sugar high.<br><br>
	HAAAAALP meh.<br><br>
	Or, don&#8217;t&#8230;.because these nutritionally dense little delectables are actually made with fiber-rich ground oat flour, protein-laden little chia seeds, and healthy monounsaturated fat-containing coconut oil.

<li>In a small bowl, combine the chia seeds and water and let sit for about 5 minutes until the texture is gooey and gelatinous. This is your &#8220;egg.&#8221; If you own a bullet blender, I actually whip these two ingredients together in one of those and the texture comes out even more gooey and egg-like. Perfecto.</li>
<li>Combine chia &#8220;egg&#8221;, peanut butter, coconut oil, brown sugar, and vanilla in a bowl or in an electric mixer until thoroughly combined. <strong>*</strong>NOTE: If your coconut oil is already melted due to sitting out in room temp/warm weather, stick it in the freezer until it hardens up a bit!</li>
<li>Slowly mix baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cocoa powder, non-dairy milk, and oat flour until dough forms. To make oat flour, simply grind up old-fashioned rolled oats in a food processor until a powdery flour-like consistency is reached.  You might also be able to use a coffee grinder but don&#8217;t quote me on that one. You can also purchase oat flour in most grocery stores.</li>
<li>Carefully add in peanut butter cups and stir until just combined.</li>
<li>Shape dough into balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet.</li>
<li>Sprinkle each cookie with sea salt.</li>
<li>Bake for ~10 minutes, the coconut oil will keep hardening after they come out so don&#8217;t cook any longer than this even if they look too wet when you take them out of the oven.  Let cool for 15 minutes! Trust me on this one, just let it be.</li>
<li>Then devour.</li>

<p id="description">

This recipe is one I have made many, many times over and is my go-to brownie recipe that combines almond and rice flour for a fudgey chewy texture with smooth coconut oil, gooey chia seeds, and rich dark chocolate for the perfect brownie to bite into. A balanced diet is surely a brownie in each hand.

<h2>Makes ~12 brownies</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 cup raw almonds</li>

<li style="text-align: left;">1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 cup dark chocolate chips (go for quality here&#8230;like Ghirardellhi, it&#8217;s worth the extra dollar and a half over Nestle PROMISE)</li>

<li>Pre heat the oven to &#8230;.350?</li>
<li>Begin by putting making an &#8220;egg&#8221; out of the chia seeds.  Combine the seeds with the water and let sit for at least 5 minutes, until it begins to coagulate and become much like the texture of an egg.  Set aside.</li>
<li>Place the almonds in a food processor and pulse into you get a relatively fine flour.</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, combine your ground almond flour, the rice flour, corn starch, cocoa powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and baking soda.</li>

<p id="description">
Happy New Year!!! Well 2014 was full of a ton of interesting and exciting challenges; to name just a few I worked in one of my favorite bakeries and learned so much about cookies and pastries and pies (oh my), bought a new road bicycle, went to a ton of concerts, went wine tasting, backpacked the Channel Islands, backpacked my way through Mendocino National Forest, mountain biked in Salt Lake City, went bungee jumping, started graduate school, moved to Los Angeles, made new friends, cooked a lot, hiked a lot, painted a little&#8230;wow my life sounds so much eventful than it really is. I also wasted my fair share of free time sitting on the couch drinking cheap champagne and watching Hey Arnold.<br><br>
Anywho, with the new year upon us, we all know that the number one resolution is to work out more. And I&#8217;ve got the perfect recipe to accompany this resolution!  How is it possible to whip up a bowl of rich chocolate ice cream that has no dairy in it, no refined sugar, and packs over 6 grams of fiber and 30 grams of protein? That&#8217;s right, 30 grams of protein.<br><br>
Hi 2015, I see you.  So&#8230;Work out. Eat ice cream. Repeat. Sounds good, ya?<br><br>
Bros, can I can an amen? The gym is that way &#8212;-&gt; by the way.<br><br>
I&#8217;ll meet you there.<br><br>
I am about to drop some knowledge, lovers and friends.<br><br>
This homemade soft serve ice cream is made with frozen bananas, soymilk, cocoa powder, and almond butter.  The nut butter I used (pictured above) is called Yumbutter.  As the name implies, it&#8217;s super yummy&#8230;and it&#8217;s not just any nut butta&#8217; either&#8230;it&#8217;s full of superfoods like chia and hemp seeds, goji berries, and coconut oil.  On top of that, it has 6 grams of protein per serving, no refined sugar, and comes in a kewl little no-mess pouch you can easily bring on the go.<br><br>
This ice cream is an extremely simple recipe; it requires no ice cream maker I promise.  If I had one of those I would have to sacrifice rent for like a month.  It&#8217;s on my christmas list every year and liiike, never makes an appearance under the tree. Sad face fa real.
<br><br>
Not only will this ice cream satisfy any sweet tooth you have and are trying to ditch as the new year comes around the corner, but all the protein and healthy fats will keep you fully satisfied. Netflix marathon after dinner, bring it on babeh.

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">

Okay, so I solemnly swore not to make any dumb date puns on this post but the temptation is all too great.  And I just. can&#8217;t. resist.<br><br>
&#8230;I&#8217;ve got a hot date tonight.<br><br>
With my <del>boyfriend </del> blender. And trust me, it&#8217;s going to be really, really good.  No awkward moments where you both pretend to reach for the bill.  You don&#8217;t have to laugh at his corny jokes. You don&#8217;t have to make out after you&#8217;ve scarfed down a salad filled to the brim with red onions.  Just sit&#8230;and sip.<br><br>
Have you ever craved a chocolate milkshake? Umm&#8230;yeah, me too. Far too often than I care to admit.  As in liiiiiike&#8230;every day.  And this delicious shake satisfies that sweet tooth. I wouldn&#8217;t be posting it if it didn&#8217;t.  You think I&#8217;d be all up on here posting a weenie little vegan shake that tastes like chalk and rabbit pellet?  Absolutely not.<br><br>
This shake is made with bananas, almond milk, cacao/cocoa, and WOAH you guessed it, sweetened with dates.  I started experimenting with dates when I began cutting back on refined sugars in my baking.  Along with honey, maple syrup, and agave, it turns out making a paste from thick and chewy dates is a wonderful way to add a little natural sweetness. Dates, despite their off-putting wrinkly exterior (see off-putting photo above), are loaded with fiber, iron, potassium, and vitamins A and K.  Mix them up with the rest of the ingredients like potassium-loaded banana and fibrous chia seeds, and you&#8217;ve got pure unadulterated creamy dreamy chocolatey goodness that&#8217;s healthy, too.<br><br>
Ladies can I get an amen.<br><br>
Aaaaaand it&#8217;s amazing topped with granola for a nice pre-sweat-inducing bicycle ride.<br><br>
</p>

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>3 Medjool dates (these are the stickier, sweeter type but really any type will do)</li>
<li>2.5 T cacao (unsweetened cocoa powder will work beautifully too!)</li>
<li>1 banana, frozen if possible</li>
<li>1 cup almond milk, or other non dairy beverage like soymilk</li>
<li>1 T chia seeds</li>
<li>4 or 5 ice cubes</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Add ingredients to blender&#8230;.</li>
<li>Blend.</li>
<li>Are we following? Groovy.  But wait!  There is ONE exception: the dates!  You can either let them soak for 10 minutes in warm water or (if lazy like myself, read on) throw them in a bowl, cover with water, and microwave for about a minute or a minute and a half. Then take out the pits and add them in with everything else and blend, blend, blend away!</li>
<li>If you have time to plan ahead, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">best</span> to add the chia seeds to the nut milk and let them soak for a good 10 minutes.  Chia seeds are super absorbent little guys and they will thicken up the milk.  This shake is great plain, or you can put on your fancy pants and top it with almond butter, granola, or fresh fruit.</li>
<li>Getcho&#8217; sip on.</li>

<h1>Best Chocolate Chip Cookies Ever</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/bestchocolatechipcookiesever.png"></p>



<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
I&#8217;ve got a confession to make.<br><br>
I&#8217;ve been holding out on you&#8230;<br><br>
These are literally the best chocolate chip cookies you will ever make.<br><br>
Would I ever lie you to?  Ain&#8217;t nobody got time for that.<br><br>

Not to, uh, toot my own horn or anything but this recipe took home Best in Show in the Baked Goods competition at the Siskiyou County Fair.  This annual fair was just about the most exciting thing that happened to the little town I lived in nestled in the mountains of Northern California.  I uh, ruthlessly beat out 25 other sweet old grannies who probably brought cookie recipes that were handed down from generation to generation with my own snarky secretly healthier vegan chocolate chip cookies.  Alright, fine, not my shining moment, but I was pretty happy with that pretty big pink ribbon.<br><br>
All the butter that normally saturates a chocolate chip cookie is replaced with yummy antioxidant rich coconut oil.  The flour is a mix of 100% whole wheat and oats to create a nice dense and chewy texture. Toasted almonds are thrown in for added protein, fiber, and of course, flavor. These can absolutely be made gluten free by using all purpose gluten free flour and certified gl<span style="color: #000000;">uten free oatmeal.  I have made them this way, and they are still really good, but let&#8217;s get real&#8230;.not AS good <br><br>
HOWEVER, unless you want your cookie to taste like a gritty hockey puck of mule turd and chocolatey sand, make sure the oatmeal is instant and you&#8217;re not just throwing in old fashioned rolled oats. I have made this mistake a couple of times&#8230;.no bueno, and although they do not actually take on the flavor of mule turd, the consistency is thrown way off.  I buy the little packets of regular unflavored instant oatmeal. 
<br><br>
Also, the brand of chocolate chips you buy will probably make or break the cookie.  I have used Nestle with sub par results&#8230;.Ghirardelli is the best!<br><br>
The egg that would normally bind these babies is actually replaced with chia seeds.  Have you ever used chia seeds in baking?  You mix chia seeds and water and they coagulate into a texture that&#8217;s almost identical to gooey eggs.  Ground flax seed/golden flax meal can also accomplish this.  This means you can eat as much raw cookie dough without any risk of getting ill!  Win for the cookie dough enthusiast! Big time fail for those skinny jeans hiding in the back of your closet.<br><br>
Mmmm chia.  You magical little seeds, you.  So crunchy.   So slimy.  So&#8230;versatile.  Full of omega 3&#8217;s, fiber, manganese, and phosphorus&#8230;can you say, &#8220;Cha-cha-cha-chia!!?&#8221;<br><br>
This cookie is just screaming, &#8220;eat meeeee.&#8221;<br><br>
And who am I to argue?
</p>

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>3/4 cup coconut oil</li>
<li>2 3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
<li>3 cups<strong> instant</strong> oatmeal</li>
<li>1 T soymilk or other non-dairy milk</li>
<li>2 T vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 chia or flax &#8220;eggs&#8221; &#8212;&gt; (2 T chia seeds/ground flax seeds mixed with 6 T water)</li>
<li>1 1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
<li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
<li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
<li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>
<li>3/4 cup almonds</li>
<li>3/4 cup Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
<li>Toast the almonds.  This amps up the flavor profile by a million!  Simply place in the oven on a baking sheet for 6-9 minutes or put almonds in a regular toaster oven until the nuts begin to turn a light brown color and release a toasted aroma.  Stir frequently and watch them like a hawk, they will burn within a matter of seconds.  Put down the chocolate chips and pay attention!  When sufficiently toasted, set aside.</li>
<li>Create the &#8220;egg&#8221; by mixing together the 2 T of chia seeds or flax along with 6 T of water in a little bowl.  Let it sit for at least 5 minutes.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, cream together the coconut oil and brown sugar.  If the coconut oil is too hard, pop it in the microwave for about 30 seconds until it is softened into the creamy consistency of butter.</li>
<li>Add in the vanilla and non-dairy milk.  Beat in the &#8220;egg&#8221;</li>
<li>Stir in the 3 cups of instant oats</li>
<li>In a different bowl, mix together the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg</li>
<li>Pour the dry ingredients into the bowl with the wet ingredients and oats and mix well until a dough forms</li>
<li>Add in the toasted almonds and chocolate chips</li>
<li>Form dough into small balls and place on a greased cookie sheet.  I greased mine with coconut oil because I&#8217;m efficient like that.</li>
<li>Bake cookies for a mere 9-10 minutes.  The trick with these cookies is to take them out of the oven just before they have fully cooked.  Something about the coconut oil will harden them if you bake them too long.  This preserves the softness we all love in a classic chocolate chip cookie.</li>

I had these grandiose visions of Halloween this year&#8230;galavanting around the city of Los Angeles in a fabulous homemade costume and making mischief with a cup of witches brew in one hand and a broom in the other.<br><br>
Buuuuuuut, in reality, I will most likely burrito myself in a blanket on the couch and eat candy corn by myself.<br><br>
That actually sounds equally enjoyable.<br><br>
Don&#8217;t be too spooked from these delicious treats. These yummy, nutritious, and creative Banana Boo Pops are a healthy and pretty dang cute alternative to those 9-pound sacks of high-fructose-corn-syrup-candies that are tempting you while you&#8217;re supposed to be buying toilet paper at Rite Aid. They&#8217;re full of potassium, healthy fats, and fiber. Grab some popsicle sticks (or fancy shmancy straws) and let&#8217;s get crafty.

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
	I really debated whether or not I would post this recipe<br><br>
	Beads of sweat collecting on my brow (chefs, you know exactly what I mean) I slaved away in my little apron and then when it finally came out, it looked like&#8230;.well&#8230;<br><br>
	How do I phase this in a way that you won&#8217;t be completely deterred from making it?!<br><br>
	(De-turd, is more like it.)<br><br>
	As you can see, it&#8217;s not the prettiest dish I&#8217;ve ever made. It&#8217;s somewhat, oh,<br><br>hell.  It looks like cat poop. <br><br>
	I swear, this pate is absolutely amazing&#8230;it has so many intricate flavors mixed throughout; I couldn&#8217;t <strong>not</strong> post it.  Initially, I thought I would spread it on some crackers, but once I tasted it, I knew the earthy sage would pair beautifully with a sweet, tart green apple. Thus, apple chips were the chosen sidekicks to this hearty and complex nutty dip.
Not only can you impress people with your innovative use of healthy plant-based ingredients, you can floor them with your use of the word &#8220;pate.&#8221; It&#8217;s a win-win. Just don&#8217;t forget to dress up this dish, the dip does require a little&#8230;uh&#8230;accessorizing.

<h2>Makes about 2 cups of dip, about 60 cals per 2T</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>1 fresh whole green apple</li>
<li>1 lb mushrooms (baby bella or cremini) diced finely</li>
<li>1/2 cup diced yellow onion</li>
<li>1/2 cup walnuts</li>
<li>3 T fresh sage leaves, minced finely + a little more for garnish</li>
<li>3 T sherry</li>
<li>4 T nutritional yeast (can also use Parmesan cheese if not vegan, but the nutritional yeast really gives it a lot of its flavor)</li>

<li>First and foremost, toast those walnuts up.  Arrange them on a pan and put them in the toaster on top of a sheet of foil.  Toast on medium heat for 3-5 minutes, watching carefully and checking very frequently so they don&#8217;t burn. They&#8217;re sufficiently toasted when they turn a light brown color and give off a more nutty, roasted aroma. Take them out and set aside. These babies can burn in the blink of an eye, so stay attentive.</li>
<li>Next, heat up 1 tsp of olive oil over medium high heat and toss in the diced onions.  Cook them for about 3-4 minutes until tender.</li>
<li>Place the mushrooms in a food processor and pulsate until finely chopped. Add the mushrooms into the pan with the onion and cook for another 4-5 minutes, allowing the &#8216;shrooms to let off most of their moisture.</li>
<li>Add the 3 T of minced fresh sage into the pan along with the salt and pepper, and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add in the sherry and cook down for another 2-3 minutes, scraping the pan as you go along.</li>
<li>Remove pan and turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Add all the contents of the pan into a food processor along with the walnuts, the nutritional yeast, and the remaining 2 tsp of oil. Process until smooth. Garnish with remaining sage.</li>
<li>Cut an apple into thin, even slices and arrange them around the pate.  Sprinkle some minced sage on top.  Dip the chips into the pate, say &#8220;pate&#8221; one more time, and then you&#8217;re free to go to town. Bon appetite!</li>

<h1>Sesame Asparagus with Sweet Soy Sauce</h1>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
Usually around my house we abide by: if it&#8217;s yellow, leave it mellow.  Let&#8217;s save water here, okay? I&#8217;m trying to save the Earth, okay? However, this rule is completely ignored when asparagus is eaten.  TMI, I&#8217;m sorry. What is it about asparagus that makes our shi-shi smell funky?  If you have ever wondered, it happens to be due to asparagusic acid, which our body breaks down into sulfur containing compounds.  These, much like rotten eggs, don&#8217;t smell so fresh.  Anyways, food for thought.<br><br>
This recipe is pretty simple, and makes for a terrific side dish.  Even though it feels much like purgatory when I step outside, the bottoms of my flip flops almost melting into the concrete, it technically still is Spring.  Spring means asparagus is at its prime, my friends. It&#8217;s sweet, crunchy, fresh, and full of folate as well as vitamins E, K, C, and A.<br><br>
A friend of mine introduced me to Kecap Manis recently, it&#8217;s basically an Indonesian sweet take on soy sauce. When combined with roasted veggies&#8230;.Hallelujah.  I could eat veggies for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner if it&#8217;s perpetually smothered in this.<br><br>
So simple, and yet, so YUM.  Another testament to the fact that good cooking doesn&#8217;t have to mean <strong>fancy</strong> cooking.  I mean I wore my apron while cooking today, and that&#8217;s about as fancy as I got. Whether or not I was wearing gym shorts underneath is negotiable and irrelevant.

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>1 bunch fresh asparagus</li>
<li>8 oz fresh cremini or button mushrooms (shitake would also be good if you&#8217;re willing to pay a bit more)</li>
<li>1 T sesame oil (olive works as well)</li>
<li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>

<li>1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce/gluten-free tamari</li>
<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>

<li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees</li>
<li>Rinse asparagus and snap off the ends by holding each spear and breaking off the bottom 1&#8243;</li>

<li>Spread asparagus and &#8216;shrooms on a baking dish.  Add oil and roll veggies around until they&#8217;re all smothered.

<li>While the veggies are roasting, throw brown sugar and soy sauce in a pot over <strong>low</strong> heat.  Stir frequently (about 10 minutes) until it thickens into the consistency of maple syrup.  Don&#8217;t let it boil or burn! Be patient.  The Housewives can wait, so can you.  Stir in garlic powder once it&#8217;s the correct thickness.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
While I should have been memorizing all of the enzymes and pathway intermediates involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, I was instead sitting in the coffee shop dreaming up how to roast these pumpkin seeds and if they should be savory&#8230;garlic, rosemary, pepper&#8230;or sweet&#8230;sugar, cinnamon, cocoa powder.<br><br>
Priorities, right?<br><br>
Upon opening my spice cabinet, the first thing I saw (or, rather, the first thing to fly forward and almost gouge out my left eye) was garlic powder.  Our kitchen may look semi-organized upon first glance, but just open a cabinet and you will realize the level of deception that underlies this household.<br><br>
This post will give you detailed instructions on how to put those slimy pumpkin guts to delicious use! If you&#8217;re feeling up to it after an intense pumpkin carving sesh, roast up the seeds and bask in all of their their zinc-vitamin E-vitamin-K-and-healthy fat-rich glory.<br><br>

<li style="text-align: left;">A pumpkin with seeds</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>The first and most labor-intensive step is to wash all the orange guts off of the seeds.  I found the best way to do this was to pick at them over a colander with cool running water.  There really is no easy and quick way to do this, but it&#8217;s the most important step so suck it up. Yummies are to follow, I promise, and it will all be worth it.</li>
<li>This may seem like a weird next step, but it makes the seeds easier to digest and creates a crunchier seed.  Once the seeds are cleaned, throw them in a pot of water along with 1 tsp of salt and bring to a boil. Once the water begins to boil, lower the heat so the water simmers and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes.  Also, pre heat your oven to 325 degrees!</li>
<li>Throw the seeds back in the colander and then spread them out on a few paper towels and pat dry.  Just give &#8217;em a little pat, we don&#8217;t need them any drier than my Thursday night biochemistry lecture. Got enough of dat. Thanks.</li>
<li>Toss the seeds in a bowl with a 1/2-1 tsp of oil.  I used olive oil because I ended up making savory seeds but you could try coconut oil if you&#8217;ve got a sweet tooth that needs a little TLC.</li>
<li>Next, spread the seeds out on a cookie sheet, being careful not to let any overlap or you could end up with (god forbid) unevenly cooked seeds.  The horror.  Sprinkle the punkin seeds with a generous amount of whatever spices you have dreamt up while other, actually important things in life need your attention. I chose garlic powder (or did the garlic powder choose me?) pepper, and sea salt.  Other combinations could include rosemary, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, herb salt&#8230;you get the idea.  If you&#8217;re going the sweet route, maybe brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, cocoa powder, or ground cloves.</li>
<li> Bake at 325 for around 8-10 minutos, then open the oven and stir the seeds.  Bake again for another 8-10 minutos, watching the seeds like a hawk so they do not burn. Test a few right out of the oven; they&#8217;re done when they feel crispy and look lightly golden brown. Let the seeds cool completely before storing them in an air tight container. Add to salads, soups, or just snarf by the handful</li>

Shall we flip our pinkies up now or later?<br><br>
These fresh-from-the-farmer&#8217;s-market little bites are jam packed with a variety of flavors and textures that are as different as day and night but play together like a beautiful, harmonious symphony.
We&#8217;ve got juicy freshness from the apricots, sweetness from the dates, crunch from the walnuts, creaminess from the cheese, and a savory drizzle of thick balsamic.  What am I forgetting? Oh yes, yes.  The sea salt.  That&#8217;s what takes these babies to some next level s#*@.<br><br>
I went home for a week and served these up to my grams and her lady friends. I think they were a grand slam.  I can surmise this because granny doesn&#8217;t consider anything besides Ritz crackers and Monterey jack squares to be hors d&#8217;oeuvres worthy.<br><br>
My week in the country flew by in the wink of an eye; it&#8217;s so beautiful and such a refreshing deviation from the city. I hiked, I wine tasted, I cooked. But I really <em>cooked.</em>  I gathered eggs from the hen hutch for my quiche.  I picked mint from the garden for a poppy seed dressing.  I smothered pasta in spaghetti sauce made from tomatoes Mom had jarred.  Ahhhh it&#8217;s the little things&#8230;.Speaking of which:

It has been a crazy several weeks, to say the least.  But crazy in the absolute best sense of the word.  Which is the reason my posts have been slackin&#8217;.  Sowey.  I have moved and am officially a Los Angeleno, I started my graduate school program, and found the perfect cute little apartment in the city to live with one of my dearest friends from college. Life is pretty sweet right about meow.<br><br>
But enough about me.  Let&#8217;s talk about this hummus.  Hubba, hubba, right?<br><br>
I used to make multiple batches of hummus, every single day for a straight year, when I worked as a chef for a wine bar.  Although I really enjoyed it, I definitely grew weary of the repetitive process.  Thus, despite the relative simplicity of the recipe, I have shied away from making it out of sheer boredom.  BUT, it has been over a year since my days of churning out chickpea paste like a robot and I have must admit, I have missed it.  This recipe is a fresh take on that good ole classic hummus recipe that I hold so near and dear to my heart. Or stomach. Probably both.
<br><br>
It&#8217;s got a little sweetness from the, you guessed it, sweet potatoes.  And it&#8217;s got a really zesty kick thanks to the cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes.  Don&#8217;t like spicy?  Tone it down by adding less pepper.  Simple as that! You don&#8217;t have to put on any fancy pants to get down on some hummus.  The hippies have killed any hope for that. Just kidding, hippies, you know I love you and am actually one of you.<br><br>
You start by roasting up those sweet potaters&#8217; nice and toasty&#8230;<br><br>
And once I realized how amazing roasted sweet potatoes are just on their own, I could not stop eating said sweet potatoes.  I foresee a sweet potato fries recipe on the horizon&#8230;.
<br><br>

Tahini is basically just sesame seeds ground into a paste, and the consistency is similar to nut butters. It&#8217;s a delicious world we live in, kids.  Enjoy this hummus with some whole wheat pita bread, broccoli, carrots, or sliced up bell peppers.  Feel free to share, but only if you have to.
</p>

<hr>



<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>2 medium sized sweet potatoes</li>
<li>1 can chickpeas/garbanzo beans</li>
<li>juice from 1 lemon, zest from 1/2 of the same lemon</li>
<li>3 1/2 T tahini</li>
<li>3 T olive oil</li>
<li>1/4 tsp sea salt</li>
<li>5 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
<li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
<li>a few shakes of crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>sesame seeds (optional, sprinkled on top of hummus)</li>
<li>For serving: pita bread/veggies for dippin&#8217; and dunkin&#8217;</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Begin by roasting the sweet potatoes.  There are many ways to cook these guys up, actually.  The method I used was to wrap each one in tin foil and bake in the oven at 400 degrees for 45 minutes to an hour, until they&#8217;re squeezable in texture.  I just put mine on a cookie sheet but feel free to use any small baking dish, too.  I always poke some holes in the foiled potatoes before I stick them in the oven!  Maybe this is one of those kitchen myths, but I am not down for explosions of any kind so I just abide&#8230;When done, unwrap and easily peel the skins off.  Then dice. Another method is to peel the raw sweet potatoes first, then dice and steam for about 20-25 minutes. Whatever butters your biscuit.</li>
<li>When &#8216;taters are cooked, place them in the food processor with all other ingredients and give them a whirl.  Make sure to blend until mixture is no longer chunky and becomes a smooth paste.</li>
<li>Check the seasoning level, if it tastes a little bland, add in more salt.  If it needs more spice, add in a few shakes of red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper.</li>
<li>When suitable, shake some sesame seeds or red pepper flakes on top and serve with warm pita or crudite veggies.</li>

	I love art.  And I love food.<br><br>
	Let's combine.  Shall we?<br><br>
	Absolutely.  Happy to.  <br><br>
	We went to the farmer&#8217;s market in Santa Monica last weekend and I felt like a little kid in a (healthy) candy store. I was bowled over by the plethora of colorful summery fresh produce.  Among the loot were a variety of brightly hued bunches of cauliflower, chard, and heirloom carrots.  It got me thinking about how I could try to turn one of these pretty little veggies into a beautiful meal.<br><br>
	Later on in the afternoon as I was sauntering down the aisles of a grocery store that I can actually afford to shop in (Trader Joe&#8217;s aka The Motherland aka Mecca) I saw purple potatoes.  Mmmm. Yes.  The wheels began to churn.<br><br>
	The color of these potatoes when you cut them in half is amazingly vibrant and bold.  What makes these guys purple?  Anthocyanins.  These flavinoids are potent antioxidants, the same ones found in blueberries and pomegranates.<br><br>
	Doused in a garlicy tahini drizzle and crisped to perfection in the oven, these tasty little taters are seriously delicious (and addictive) nutritional powerhouses.

<hr>



<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">5 purple potatoes (or any kind of potato)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 T tahini</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 T water</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 T tamari or soy sauce</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3 cloves garlic</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">olive oil to grease baking pan with</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1-2 scallions</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">sea salt</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">black sesame seeds (optional)</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
	<li>Start by rinsing the potatoes under cold water. Next grab a big bag of pot.  Just kiddin, just grab a big pot and place it on the stove over high heat.  Drop in the potatoes and cover with water.  Bring to a boil and boil for 20-25 minutes (depending on the variety of potato).  They are done when you can easily pierce them with a fork.</li>
<li>Drain potatoes and set aside. Let cool for at least 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Pre heat oven to  450 degrees.</li>
<li>Lay potatoes on a lightly greased baking sheet and using something flat and round (I used the bottom of a coffee mug&#8230;.sorry, roomie&#8230;swear I washed it) press down on each potato until it smashes slightly.  No worries if it gets a little crumbly.</li>
<li>Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, depending on the potato and your oven.  Mine were done after 13 minutes.  Check on them after 10 minutes and take them out when they start to brown slightly around the edges.</li>
<li>While the potatoes are baking, whip up the sauce.  If you want to use roasted garlic, simply throw 3 cloves in with the potatoes on the same baking sheet and wait to make the sauce until the potatoes are cooked. If not (although I recommend this step as it adds a deeper, richer garlic flavor) then mince garlic finely and place into a bowl or food processor along with tahini, water, and tamari (or soy sauce).  If not using a food processor, whip the crap out of the mixture with a whisk until smooth and creamy.  If using food processor, simply puree.</li>
<li>When potatoes are done, take them out and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Mince green onions finely.</li>
<li>Drizzle each potato with some of the sauce, sprinkle with green onion (scallions), and then lightly sprinkle each one with a pinch of sea salt.  This really takes all the flavors to the next level.</li>
<li>Sprinkle with green onion and black sesame seeds.</li>
<li>Shovel in mouth.</li>

<li style="text-align: left;">3 lbs of fresh apples</li>

	<li>First you have to peel all those apples. I know, I know&#8230;but it&#8217;s so worth it.</li>
<li>Slice the apples up into smallish chunks. Smallish is a word in my kitchen.</li>
<li>Place Medjool dates in a cup of hot water for 5 minutes (or place in a dish of water and microwave for 30 seconds&#8230;the point is to soften them).  When soft to the touch, take out the pits and place into food processor.  Pulsate until dates form a soft paste.</li>
<li>Transfer date paste, apples, and all other remaining ingredients into a large pot over medium heat.</li>
<li>Cook for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add more cinnamon if you want more spice&#8230;</li>
<li>Place half of the mixture into a food processor, or mash by hand to achieve desired level of &#8220;chunkiness&#8221; or &#8220;smoothness.&#8221;  I pureed half of mine and left the other half chunky&#8230;but the choice is yours.</li>
<li>If you spoon some of this applesauce while it&#8217;s warm over vanilla ice cream, you may never feel the need to make another new friend in your life. Just sayin&#8217;.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
	So&#8230;sweet potatoes just got a whole lot savvier<br><br>
	Slice &#8217;em &amp; pair &#8217;em with a side of Sriracha ketchup dipping sauce&#8230;and you might as well send these babies off to Le Cordon Bleu.<br><br>
	And I&#8217;m not big on french fries&#8230;<br><br>
	You may be wondering if I am, indeed, from planet Earth. I myself question this on the daily.  However, put a plate of sweet potato fries in front of me&#8230;<br><br>
	And, well, have you ever watched your dog jump up and just swallow his treat whole?  You&#8217;re like, &#8220;where did it go? Did you even enjoy that?&#8221;<br><br>
	These sweet potato fries are <em>absolutely addictive</em><br><br>
	Baking them to be crispy and not soggy is a labor of love, but so worth it. It&#8217;s like your chaperoning a middle school homecoming dance; the trick here is to keep them from touching one another.<br><br>
	Freshly cut Vitamin A and B-6 packed sweet potatoes are rolled in a bit of corn starch for crusting purposes, sprinkled generously with salt and pepper, and baked to crispy perfection.  Get nice and baked. No frying up in here. No sir.<br><br>
	Additionally, you can add in garlic powder, fresh rosemary, or switch up the flavor profile completely by opting to use cinnamon and sugar instead. To top it all off, tomato ketchup is swirled with spicy Sriracha sauce so your fries have a lil somethin&#8217; somethin&#8217; to soak in. I mean you may not be Tyson Chandler but I&#8217;m giving you permission to make some dunks.<br><br>

<h2>Makes ~4 Servings, each serving (~10 fries) is around 135 cals.</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">2 large sweet potatoes</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">2 T olive oil</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">2 tsp organic corn starch</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">salt/pepper</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
	<li>Start by peelin&#8217; those &#8216;taters. Go slow as to avoid accidental peeling of own epidermis.</li>
<li>Pre-heat the oven to 415 degrees. I burnt mine at 425 so if your oven is a lagger and you&#8217;re feeling adventurous, you could try it at 425 and just keep a watchful eye.</li>
<li>Chop the potatoes into medium-thick strips, you can peep my photos above to get a better idea of what I mean here.</li>
<li>Put the potato slices into a gallon zip lock bag and add in the cornstarch.  Shake them up. Preferably in private as to avoid looking like the dude from the shake weight commercial.</li>
<li>After they&#8217;re dusted with corn starch, gently massage your fries with the olive oil, making sure to coat each one lightly.</li>
<li>Lay the strips on a cookie sheet, I ended up using 2 cookie sheets and baked them in 2 different batches.</li>
<li>Spread your fries out flat on the pan, the trick is to keep them separated from one another. When they&#8217;re properly arranged, sprinkle with salt and pepper or you can add garlic powder, red chili pepper flakes, dried rosemary&#8230;or even use a sweet cinnamon/sugar combo if the mood strikes. Use spices at your discretion.</li> 

<li>Bake the fries at 415 for 8 minutes, but timing varies per oven so keep checking! DO NOT BURN! I made that mistake the first time. I ate the fries anyway because I&#8217;m not a quitter. But still, be careful. Then take out the fries and using a fork, or if you&#8217;re a badass ninja, your hands, and flip each fry over.  Bake another 3-4 minutes. They&#8217;re done when they develop a <strong><em>light</em></strong> brown freckled color. Let them cool before devouring.</li>
<li>To make a dipping sauce, simply whisk together 1 T of ketchup per 1/2 tsp Sriracha!  If you like them crispy, eat these fries right away! Trust me, it won&#8217;t be difficult </li>

	St. Patrick&#8217;s Day is upon us, my friends.<br><br>
	Sooo, if you&#8217;re like, 1/16th Irish, can you skip work or school for the day? Does that sound totally legitimate to anyone else?<br><br>
	Because it&#8217;s officially finals week (AGAIN) and by Tuesday I&#8217;m expecting a 0% chance of a shower, sweat pants throughout the day, and absolutely no signs of giving AF.
	<br><br>
	What to do, what to do.  Smoothie it up, my friends.  Whip up a frosty green shake that will make you feel like the Irish Incredible Hulk.  Healthy fats, fiber, and a hefty dose of vitamin K, vitamin C, and potassium...what's not to drool over? This smoothie is sweet, creamy, and the fresh mint adds a refreshing and energizing green zing.</p>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">Got some brown bananas that you don't want to feed to your worms or throw in the compost? (should be browner than these babies but they were thrown into this recipe faster than my camera could snap up!) Then put them to some deliciously good use in this sweet treat.<br><br>This recipe is based on the banana muffins my mamma used to bake when I was little. The cookbook, that's older than me, always opens right to this page, hardened by splatters of batter and torn from the pages sticking together. It's our favorite!</p>
<hr>
<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
	<li>A loaf pan or I like to use a cupcake pan or muffin tin</li> 
	<li>A mixing bowl</li> 
	<li>Something to mash and mix with (fork, whisk, spoon?)</li>
	<li>An oven would also be useful</li> 
	<li>Something wooden and pokey (to check that it's done)</li> 
	<li>3 *very* ripe bananas</li> 
	<li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li> 
	<li>1 tablespoon flaxseed meal or chia seeds + 2-3 T agua</li> 
	<li>4 T coconut oil melted, but not super hot (use some to grease the pan)</li> 
	<li>1 1/2 cup flour (I usually do whole wheat flour or half whole wheat/half all purpose, or substitute some for buckwheat flour)</li> 
	<li>1 tsp salt</li> 
	<li>1 tsp baking soda</li> 
	<li>Optional: nuts and berries (for example 1/2 cup pecans and 1 cup blueberries)</li> 
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 325 F.</li> 
	<li>Grease your pan of choice.</li> 
	<li>In a bowl, mash up those 'naners!</li> 
	<li>Make the "egg" in a separate little bowl by mixing the chia/flax with the water (agua) and let it sit for 5 minutes to become gooey.</li> 
	<li>Mix in the sugar, 'egg', and oil.</li> 
	<li>In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, salt and baking soda. Optional: Add 1 tsp cinnamon!</li> 
	<li>Mix everything gently, just until it's all moist.</li> 
	<li>I love to chop up some pecans and add a bunch of blueberries. Then gently fold them into the batter. Also save a sprinkle of pecan pieces for the top, to add a little crunch.</li> 
	<li>Pour batter into the lightly greased pan. (Optional: lick bowl clean.)</li> 
	<li>Bake for 55 to 60 minutes in a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, around 35 minutes for a cupcake pan.</li> 
	<li>When it's done, it will begin to pull away from the sides of its pan. Check that it's done by poking the center with a wooden skewer. When the skewer or chopstick or toothpick comes out clean, the bread is done!</li> 
	<li>Let it cool in its pan on a metal rack for 10 minutes (or eat it right away and have it burn your fingers and all fall apart, like I do).Then take it out and let it cool completely.  Apparently, if you wait a day before slicing, it will be easier to slice and more flavorful. It can also be wrapped and stored in the fridge or even freezer. I have never tried that, because it has never lasted that long...</li>

Woof.

Look, I have reverted to guttural animal noises instead of the English language.  THAT'S how good these baked yummies are.  They are hearty and rich with a delicate sweetness and a gooey crumb that melts in your mouth.  I think these are my favorite and best batch of muffins to date.  And for someone who (sometimes) loves pastries more than other human beings, that is sayin' somethin'. <br><br>

These bad boys are made with fiber-laden cornmeal and oats, fresh antioxidant packed blueberries, and deliver a dose of heart healthy coconut oil. Best when warm and drizzled with so much honey, the bees bee jealous. <br><br>These are so easy to whip up and much, much easier to gobble down.  Don't be a hipster about it and eat them before they're cool; wait about 15 minutes.  Patience is a virtue. ...Or something like that.</p>

<h2>Makes about 12 muffins</h2>

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
	<li>2 1/4 cup cornmeal</li> 
	<li>2/3 cup oat flour (can purchase or make at home from grinding old fashioned rolled oats in food processor/high speed blender)</li> 
	<li>1 3/4 T baking powder</li>
	<li>1 tsp baking soda</li> 
	<li>1 1/4 tsp salt</li> 
	<li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>

	<li>1 cup brown sugar</li>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
	<li>Pre heat an oven to 350!  Spray a muffin tin or line with liners.</li> 
	<li>First and foremost, we have to curdle the milk for our own homemade version of buttermilk!  Warm the milk to a lukewarm temperature beforehand, so that later when it mixes with the melted coconut oil, it does not harden the oil.  I just poured it into a bowl and popped it in the microwave for a few seconds.  Add that apple cider vinegar to the milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Don't be freaked out when it starts to look chunky, this is supposed to happen!</li> 
	<li>While the milk is curdling, mix up the cornmeal, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl.</li> 
	<li>Ensure the coconut oil is melted, and if it's still solid or semi solid, place in the microwave or heat on the stove quickly until melted into a liquid.</li> 
	<li>Add the melted coconut oil, sugar, and vanilla to the milk mixture and thoroughly mix.</li> 
	<li>Carefully stir the liquidy mixture into the dry ingredient bowl until just combined.  Fold in the blueberries.</li> 
	<li>Pour the batter into the muffin pan, filling each cup up about 3/4 of the way. Bake about 16-17 minutes or until you stick a toothpick in and it comes out squeaky clean.  LET COOL, YO.</li>

<h1>Buckwheat Banana Bread</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/buckwheatbananabread.png"></p>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
This buckwheat banana bread is hearty, rustic, and comforting.  Despite it being gluten free, vegan, AND refined sugar free, it's got a super moist and chewy center while still maintaining a hard and crispy crust.  I was a little discouraged when the bread didn't rise as high as I wanted it to, and I speculate that if you were to use real eggs instead of the chia eggs (if you're not vegan or sensitive to eggs) you would have a much higher (like, Cheech and Chong high) loaf of banana bread.  Eggs really have a tremendous amount of functions in baked goods.  Usually I can get away with chia and flax eggs when baking sans wheat flour, but it gets tricky when you're trying to accomplish both!  Try it and let me know how it turns out!</p>


<hr>
<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
	<li>3 mashed bananas (dark and spotty preferred)</li> 
	<li>3 T coconut oil</li> 
	<li>1 cup oat flour (can make from rolled oats)</li>
	<li>3/4 cup buckwheat flour</li> 
	<li>1/2 cup almond meal</li> 
	<li>2 T ground flax meal</li> 
	<li>2 chia eggs (2 T chia seeds mixed with 6 T water)</li> 
	<li>1/2 non-dairy milk (I used vanilla almond milk)</li> 
	<li>1/4 cup + 2 T honey or agave nectar</li>
	<li>3 T applesauce</li> 
	<li>3 tsp vanilla</li> 
	<li>4 tsp cinnamon</li> 
	<li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li> 
	<li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li> 
	<li>1 tsp baking powder</li> 
	<li>1 tsp salt</li> 
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
	<li>Preheat your oven to 350! Grease and flour (aka spray with cooking spray or smother with some form of oil and then sprinkle some flour on top and shake it off) a small 9" standard 1-lb loaf pan.</li> 
	<li>To make the chia egg, simply mix together 2 T chia seeds (can also use ground flax seeds) with 6 T of water and let sit for 5-10 minutes.  Or you could see my recipe here for instructions and a better description.</li> 
	<li>In a food processor, pulverize one cup of rolled oats into a flour consistency.  Dump the flour into a large bowl along with the buckwheat flour, 2 T of ground flax meal, almond meal, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder and salt.  Stir to combine.</li> 
	<li>In another bowl, mash the (preferably on the verge of death/black) bananas with a fork.  Then stir in the coconut oil, chia/flax egg, non dairy milk, applesauce, honey/agave, and vanilla.  Mix thoroughly.</li> 
	<li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir until just combined.</li> 
	<li>Pour batter into the loaf pan and bake for 45 minutes - 1 hour.  I would check after 40 minutes, but my bread took about 57 minutes.  It really varies, but the bread is done when you stick a fork in there and the prongs come out relatively clean.</li> 
	<li>Wait 10 minutes (THIS IS THE HARDEST PART.) I get palpitations just thinking about it.  Then flip upside down onto a plate and wait another 10-15 minutes before slicing.  Oh, the agony.</li> 
	<li>Enjoy warm. If reheating, use the toaster. And also topping a slice with peanut butter= gold. FYI.</li>

<h1>Caramelized Banana Waffle Sandwich</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/caramelizedbananawafflesandwich.png"></p>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">Well, hell.<br><br>
I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't try to marry this waffle sandwich if it got down on one starchy-knee.  What is it about waffles that just gives me all of the warm fuzzies inside?
<br><br>
On weekend mornings growing up, my Dad would actually allow us to sleep in.  By 10 am we had to be up for a bike ride, but until that fateful hour, we could lay in bed peacefully.<br><br>
The coffee bean grinder would still go off like a fire alarm in my ear.  And then usually the blender.  Then most likely he'd crank up a Pink Floyd album.
<br><br>
But those rare mornings were always sacred.  And 99.9% of the time included the old family sourdough whole wheat waffle recipe. To this day I don't think I could conjure up anything more in life I could ever want on a weekend morning and this recipe is a tribute to that.  A healthier tribute, made with chia seeds and coconut oil.
<br><br>
I never knew I had the capacity to cry tears of pleasure over a waffle sandwich...until this day.  I wanted waffles in a bad, bad way.  Then I wanted a super sweet topping.  Well why not sandwich the topping in between two waffles and just make a sandwich.  I can't even look at these photos...they just make me want to high tail it to my waffle iron and go to breakfast-town.
<br><br>

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
		<span style="margin-left: -24px;">For the waffles:</span>
	<li>1/2 cup buckwheat flour</li> 
	<li>1 1/2 cups white rice flour (brown rice flour would work, too) ***See note at bottom</li> 
	<li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>

	<li>1/4 cup coconut oil</li>
	<li>2 T chia seeds + 6 T water (can also use ground flax seeds)</li> 
	<li>2 1/3 cups non-dairy milk (I used cashew milk)</li>

		<span style="margin-left: -24px;">For the caramelized banana filling:</span>
	<li>2 bananas</li> 
	<li>2 T vegan butter (such as Earth balance, or some other non-dairy margarine)</li>

	<li>Turn on dat waffle iron...get it all nice and roasty toasty. Drooling already...yikes</li> 
	<li>Mix together all the dry fixins': the flours, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar in a medium sized bowl until thoroughly combined.</li> 
	<li>The chia seeds in this recipe are taking the place of eggs and are supposed to be ground.  To do this, take a high speed blender or food processor and combine the 2 T of chia seeds with the 6 T of water and blend until a thin paste forms.  This step ensures a more smooth, less gritty waffle.  If using ground flax seeds instead of chia, skip this step and simply combine 2 T ground flax meal with 6 T water in a small bowl and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li> 
	<li>Make a well in the center of the bowl of dry ingredients and pour in the chia/flax mixture, the non-dairy milk, and the coconut oil.  Mix the bowl up until a batter forms.  Batter will be relatively thin...do not panic.</li> 
	<li>Pour into waffle iron and bake the sons of bitches up.</li> 
	<li>For the filling, spray a skillet with cooking spray and heat up to medium-high.</li> 
	<li>Slice the bananas into thin rounds and place bananas in the skillet.</li> 
	<li>Fry the 'naners for 1 minute.</li> 
	<li>Slice the bananas into thin rounds and place bananas in the skillet.</li> 
	<li>Reduce heat to medium and add in the vegan butter/margarine, non-dairy milk, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  Don't add in the vanilla just yet!  Cook 4-5 minutes until the mixture becomes dark brown and thick.</li> 
	<li>When it's done, pour the vanilla extract in and stir until combined.</li> 
	<li>Spread 1/4 cup filling between two waffles and....cry with pleasure.</li> <br>

	<p id="description">***You can also opt to not add in buckwheat flour and just do a whole two cups of rice flour. They will be a little lighter in color and have a less nutty flavor/texture, it's up to you, boss. </p>

<h1>Cheesy Vegan Tofu Scramble</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/cheesyvegantofuscramble.png"></p>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">When people find out I don't eat meat, the most common question I get asked is "how do you get your protein?"  Once people discover that I pretty much don't eat dairy either, the next question is asked with the same suspicious voice that detectives probably use to interrogate criminals, "but...how do you live without cheese?"<br><br>
The answer is ever-changing, because I like to switch it up.
<br><br>
Variety is the spice of life, no?<br><br>I usually mess with a lot of tofu, tempeh, beans, and quinoa.  Most of the time I prepare this low-fat protein source by marinating it and putting it into a stir fry...I'm sure I'll post that recipe at some point because it's so easy and a go-to mid-week meal I often resort to.  However, this traditional breakfast recipe is one that you can actually eat for any meal.  One of the many advantages a tofu scramble has over a regular ole egg scramble is that the tofu will keep for several days but would anyone enjoy leftover eggs 2 days after a Sunday morning breakfast?!<br><br>
...If you answered Yes to this question you are a total weirdo and we can't be friends.<br><br>

Just kidding, I always win the weirdo award. My refrigerator is frequently overflowing with mysterious concoctions that are perpetually on the brink of edible/might poison you to death.
<br><br>But don't piss in my cheerios. That's the way I like it.
<br><br>This is a simple and yet sophisticated dish made with tofu, vegetables, and, as customary with my recipes, a hefty amount of spices and seasoning.  Tofu comes from soybeans and is an excellent way to meat your non-meat (see what I did there?) protein necessities, as well as sneak in calcium, vitamin E, and a bunch of anti oxidant isoflavones. For all you tofu n00bz, I will explain how to prepare this strange block of hippy bean curd. I may not be as cool as Lennon but all I am saying is give tofu a chance.<br><br>

<hr>

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
	<li>1 package organic firm tofu</li> 
	<li>3 T low-sodium soy sauce or gluten-free tamari</li> 
	<li>3 T tahini paste</li>
	<li>1 8 oz package (or about a cup and a half) cremini or button mushrooms</li> 
	<li>1 red bell pepper</li> 
	<li>5 green onion stalks/scallions</li> 
	<li>4 T olive oil</li> 
	<li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes</li> 
	<li>/4 tsp turmeric </li>
	<li>1/2 tsp nutritional yeast *optional*</li> 
	<li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li> 
	<li>salt/pepper</li> 
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
	<li>First, young grasshopper, you will prepare that tofu.  You have to press the tofu to remove the excess moisture before cooking it, so adhere to my strange rules or else. Remove block from packaging and place on a paper towel on a plate.  Put another plate on top (this is seriously how I do it).  Place something heavy on top like a couple of cans and let it drain for 10-20 minutes.  The paper towel should be wet at the end.</li> 
	<li>While the tofu is doin its thang', slice mushrooms thinly, dice up the red pepper, and dice the green onions.</li> 
	<li>Once the tofu is pressed, heat up 2 T oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add in the mushrooms and saute until tender and mushrooms begin to let off moisture.  When they begin to sizzle, add in the pepper and onions and let them cook for another couple minutes.</li> 
	<li>Once veggies are tender, place them in a bowl and set aside.</li> 
	<li>Crank up the stovetop to medium high and heat up the remaining 2 T oil in the same saucepan.  Crumble the tofu into the oil with your hands and let it sit and cook for 3-4 minutes.</li> 
	<li>Add in the soy sauce/tamari, tahini paste, and all the spices. Stir the veggies back into the saucepan and stir up the entire scramble, cooking it for a few minutes more until the tofu begins to brown very slightly.</li> 
	<li>*Although I put nutritional yeast in the ingredient column as optional, I love this stuff and always cook with it.  It's worth buying some in the bulk bin section of your grocery store and this is what imparts the cheesy flavor to this "egg" dish.  Add in the salt and pepper as you like.</li> 
	<li>Garnish with more green onions, and add in some hot sauce too if you fancy it spicier!  I do, I do!</li> 
	<li>This dish goes great with potatoes, toast, and avocado.  Mimosa also optional. Take my word(s) for it.</li>

<h1>Cherry Chocolate Vegan Beer Bread</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/cherrychocolateveganbeerbread.png"></p>


<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">There are 3 things I do when I'm having an off day.  The first is to go for a long bicycle ride; it clears my mind and allows me to sort through all of my thoughts.  The second is to cook up something healthy and hearty; it relaxes me.  And the third is to call my best friend...for no other particular reason but for the fact that she makes me laugh and forget about whatever was bogging me down.<br><br>
That girl is hilarious.  From time to time, one of these days shows up and is all like "oh heyyy what's up?  I'm here to ruin the next 24 hours for you."  And so in the past year I have really learned to take these small simple steps in order to wake up the next morning guaranteed to be like BAM. NEW DAY. LET'S DO THIS.<br><br>A few months ago we went to Sacramento Capitol Beer Fest.  They had rows and rows of tables offering cold craft beers to sample as far as the eye could see.  Nestled right in between the capitol and the golden Tower Bridge, it was quite the epic day.  I tried a local beer called Ruhstaller and me likey...so when I spotted one of their craft coffee porter collaborations with Old Soul at Cost Plus, I had to have it. They grow their hops right off 80! Support local growers! Sweet!<br><br>
Instead of drink it lazily by the pool, which looking back now seems like it would have been equally rewarding, I decided instead to cook something with it.  Enter, whole grain beer bread.<br><br>Father's Day is coming up, and I'd say this loaf of bread is a bit like my father, hard and rigid on the exterior, but a total softy in on the inside.  Don't kill me for revealing your secrets, Pops. It's got a subtle sweetness...but the type of beer you use largely determines the flavor.  Depending on what type of beer you mix it with, vary the ingredients accordingly (ie. I used a dark coffee porter and added cinnamon, chocolate chips, dried cherries, and oats to the crust..if you're using a fruitier beer you could mix in cranberries or orange zest....or if you're using a pale beer you could add garlic and cheese to make it savory).  This recipe is very standard and can really be customized depending on how you want it to turn out.  And if Keystone lite is more your jam you could add in some garbage from your waste basket.  Just kiddin', mama didn't raise no beer snob.<br><br>
 Beer bread is so easy because you don't have to use yeast and knead the daylights out of it.  The beer and the sugar does the work for you! Yay for chemistry!<br><br>
 Science, you are so cool. The fermentation of the sugar by the little yeasty fungus gives off gas bubbles, and the air pockets that form as a result allow the dough to rise when it cooks.  Because the beer is carbonated, this step has already been taken care of for you.   Thanks, beer, I love you.  Have you thanked your beer yet, today?<br><br>This bread is soooo good sliced right out of the oven, it should be illegal. But I am so very glad it is not. Hell, who am I kidding, I'd eat it anyway.

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
	<li>2 cups whole wheat flour (I have not tried using gluten free flour yet!) & 1 cup white flour</li> 
	<li>2 T sugar</li> 
	<li>3 tsp baking powder</li>
	<li>1 tsp salt</li> 
	<li>12 oz beer (could also be soda/GF beer/non-alcoholic beer but the alcohol cooks off, anyway)</li> 
	<li>oil for greasing pan (I used coconut)</li> 
	<li>1 tsp cinnamon (optional, I added this because I used a coffee porter)</li> 
	<li>1/4 cup dark chocolate chips</li> 
	<li>1/4 cup dried cherries/li> 
	<li>a pinch of rolled old fashioned oats for the crust</li> 
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
	<li>Begin by heating your oven to 375 degrees and greasing a small 9" standard 1-lb loaf pan.
</li> 
	<li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt (and cinnamon or other herbs you might be using).</li> 
	<li>Pour beer into flour mixture and mix.  Put your back into it and it will quickly begin to form a pasty dough.  Do not overmix!</li> 
	<li>Add in cherries and chocolate and transfer the dough into the greased loaf pan.</li> 
	<li>Sprinkle loaf with oats and bake for 50 minutes.  Good toppings include earth balance vegan butter, coconut oil, peanut butter, jam, or honey. The beer flavor will mellow out as the bread cools so don't think the taste is that strong at first bite.  Enjoy!</li>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/cinnamonbakedappleswithseasaltcarameldatesauce.png"></p>



<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">Your standard classic well-known and equally loved baked apples are smothered in butter and brown sugar, but these babies are made au naturale...just apples stuffed with raisins and cinnamon but then covered in a creamy sauce made with lots of fiber and healthy fats via dates and cashews. No sugar, no dairy, no problem.<br><br>
Making these was a cinch; just core the apples, bake them, and whip up the sauce while they're getting some lovin in the oven.  <br>
The "caramel" sauce is one of the most yummy things I have made to date. Shieeeeet do I say that about every recipe? I really mean it this time. I couldn't stop eating it.<br><br>

And I ain't mad.</p>

<hr>
<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
	<span style="margin-left: -24px;">For the apples:</span>
	<li>4 apples</li> 
	<li>1 cup raisins</li> 
	<li>1 T cinnamon</li>
	<li>3/4 cup boiling water</li> 
	</ul>
	
	<ul>
	<span style="margin-left: -24px;">For the sauce</span>
	<li>1.5 cups almond milk</li> 
	<li>1 cup soaked cashews</li> 
	<li>1 cup dates</li>
	<li>3 tsp cinnamon</li> 
	<li>1/4 tsp lemon juice</li>
	<li>1 tsp vanilla</li> 
	<li>1/4 tsp sea salt</li> 
	<li>1/4 tsp lemon juice</li> 

	</ul>
</div>


<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
	<li>To get the cashews the proper consistency, you want to soak them overnight in water or for at least 3 hours prior.  This ensures that when blended, all your creamy sauce fantasies will be fulfilled.</li> 
	<li>Start off by coring the apples. To do this, I whipped out a small (and supah sharp) knife and cut around the core on the top of the apple. I grabbed a small spoon and scooped out the middle where the core and seeds chill out. Ah yes, and pre heat the oven to 375.</li> 
	<li>Sprinkle the inside middle of each apple with cinnamon generously and then stuff halfway down with raisins. You don't need to use the whole cup of raisins; save some for garnish.</li> <li>Place the stuffed apples in a baking dish and pour the 3/4 cup of boiling water in the bottom of the pan. Different apples will bake at different speeds, so check on them after 30 minutes. I just used whatever I had in my fridge and ended up with two different types of apples. One was done after 30 minutes, the other ones took almost 50! So, check after 30 so you don't bake one to golden perfection and then burn the crap out of a different one. The apples are done when the skin gets wrinkly and when stabbed with a fork, the consistency is soft but not overly mushy.</li> 
	<li>While the apples are baking, make the sauce! To soften the dates, place in hot water for 10 minutes or place in water and microwave for one minute.  Then remove all pits.</li> 
	<li>Place all sauce ingredients in a blender and gooooooooo for it.  Taste the sauce...add more salt of desired.</li>
	<li>Remove the apples from the oven when done and scoop sauce into each one to fill them up all zee way. Sprinkle with raisins and enjoy warm.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">The marriage of coconuts and dates is one party I would not throw away the invite for. There is just destined to be a good time had by all. Creamy coconut and sweet plump dates are whipped into tiny energy and nutrient rich snacks.  They are the perfect fuel for a long weekend hike...and in addition, if you need something for that sweet tooth, these are your boys, blue.<br><br>
If I were to make these sweet succulent babies again, I would use flaked instead of shredded coconut.  It will mix in easier.  You can sub in chocolate chips for cacao nibs and if you want to get all chocolate-wasted, add in a tablespoon of cocoa powder.<br><br>You can also roll these bites in cocoa powder for a fancy dusting.  I love how these little balls of energy are easy enough to make in 10 minutes but look polished enough to bring to a part-ay.  Pinkies up.</p>

<h1>Healhty Gal Granola</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/healthygalgranola.png"></p>



<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">Many a cooking recipe is born via experimentation gone wrong...I mean right. In science, we call these "happy accidents."  Did you know Sir Alexander Fleming left a petri dish out too long in 1928 and thus penicillin was born?  And sorry Romy and Michele, but post-it notes were accidentally invented by Spencer Silver in 1968 who actually set out to make something stronger.
<br><br>
And so, it was late...I needed cookies.  We've all been there...<br><br>
I set out to make scrumptious trail-mix oatmeal raisin cookies...but was feeling crafty enough to experiment. I guess I ended up adding too much coconut oil and the "dough" just fell apart in my hands.<br><br>But dude, it's chill. I spread it out on a cookie sheet and baked away for like 20 minutes.  And guess what?<br><br>
Grrrrranola was born.  So it's like that?  Yep.  It's like that.  Gluten free and vegan, it's chock-full of energy boosting ingredients like oats, chia seeds, almonds, and dried fruit.  Sweetened with sugar and coconut with a sprinkle of sea salt and cinnamon...you will most likely be spooning it straight from the pan.  I had it for breakfast one morning with some coconut milk and ate it like cereal.  And then...my roommate and I put it on top of our fro yo and....oh my.....wowz.  Just wowz.

<h2>Makes about 4-5 cups of granola</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
	<li>3 cups old fashioned rolled oats</li> 
	<li>1/2 brown sugar (or white)</li> 
	<li>1/4 cup coconut oil</li>
	<li>2 T chia seeds + 6 T water</li> 
	<li>1 tsp vanilla</li> 
	<li>1 tsp salt</li> 
	<li>1 T cinnamon</li> 
	<li>1 tsp baking powder</li> 
	<li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li> 
	<li>1/2 cup almonds</li> 
	<li>1/2 cup dried fruit (raisins, cranberries, you get the gist)</li> 
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
	<li>When measuring my oats, I decided to throw one cup out of the three into the food processor and grind until I got a fine powder.  This is an optional step, but it might bind together better.  Then place all the oats on a cookie sheet, spreading them out as evenly as you can, and bake at 375 for about 15 minutes.  Keep checking, they're done when they start to turn a toasty light brown color and give off a nice aroma.  Set aside.</li> 
	<li>Chop up the almonds and toast in the same oven at the same temperature for 4-7 minutes.  Keep checking so they don't burn!  Watch them carefully, eye 'em like a granola-lovin' hawk.  Almonds are done when they give off a roasted aroma and turn a caramel brown color.  Set aside.</li> 
	<li>Then in a small bowl, combine the chia seeds with the water.  Let it sit for about 5 minutes until the seeds coagulate and start to for a gel.  These are serving as your 'eggs...' sans feathers and beaks.  I prefer it this way.</li> 
	<li>In a large bowl, mix together the sugar and coconut oil (which should me completely melted.  If solid, stick in the microwave for a few seconds).  Then beat in the chia and water mixture along with the vanilla until fully incorporated.</li> 
	<li>In a separate bowl, fully combine the oats, salt, cinnamon, baking soda, and baking powder.</li> 
	<li>Mix the flour mixture into the sugar/coconut oil/chia/vanilla bowl and mix.  Then add in the roasted almonds and dried fruit.  When you taste the granola "batter", don't be scared that it's really sweet and also pretty salty.  When you cook it, the flavor changes!</li> 
	<li>Spread out the mixture on an ungreased cookie sheet, spreading it out as evenly and thin as possible.  Press down to try and get it super leveled out.</li> 
	<li>Bake granola at 375 for about 22-25 minutes.  Check it after 20 minutes and see how it looks, as every oven varies.  It's done when it is just starting to brown and crisp up.  Let it cool and then demolish via spoon.</li>

<p id="description">My brother came to visit me this past weekend and it was the most fun I've had in a long time. On Friday night we went bowling. In my last attempt at this sport, I bowled an 8.<br><br>

Not an 80. Or even 28. Straight up eight. Jeff Lebowski would have me thrown out of the alley before I could even buy him a White Russion. But this time, I bowled a 12. PROGRESS. I felt so proud of myself for crawling into the double digits...I mean like, might as well quit my job, buy an ugly jersey, and join a league.  Who can tell at this point.
<br><br>
We also went rock climbing at an indoor gym. I learned how to properly belay and tie a figure eight knot with a follow through. HINT: If you picture a frosty pint of IPA at the top of the wall, you will scale that son of a bitch lickety-split.
<br><br>
ASour and spunky seeks sensible and warm. Attractive, 1.5" tall, 4 lbs give or take, constantly baked and a little rough around the edges. *Must love cheese*<br><br>
Is there such a thing as a bad day when you have a slice of warm quiche first thing out of bed?  The ultimate brunch classic gets a helluva makeover-savory shiitake mushrooms, crisp scallions, and spicy/sour/salty and crunchy kimchi. With a chewy baked crust, gooey melted Gruyère, and fresh cilantro, you don't want to miss this eggy breakfast dish.<br><br>What is kimchi, you ask? It's kindaaaaa like the Korean version of sauerkraut.  It's (usually) cabbage that is brined and fermented with a variety of seasonings.  If you've never tried it, I encourage you to go out on a limb and go buy a jar...when I put it in the quiche, even my grandma was down wit it. The fermentation process involves lactic acid bacteria and research shows that just like yogurt, kimchi is considered a probiotic food that has potent anticancer, immunity boosting, cholesterol reducing, and healthy digestive system promoting properties. Dish yourself up some yum.

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">Nestled in between a thick juicy portobello mushroom, you will stumble upon an herb-infused sunny side up egg.  This dish gets real dirty, I mean like, the yolkporn on this bad boy is out of this world.
<br><br>
The shroom, as succulent as it remains, bakes up crispy and firm.  Thus, No. Toast. Even. Required.<br><br>
Eggs? Crack one up.  A wee bit of freshly grated parmesan cheese? Yes please.  <br><br>Toss this concoction over roasted potatoes and garlic and you've seriously got all your bases covered; healthy fats from the olive oil, egg, and cheese, protein in the egg and the portobello, and fiber as well as complex carbohydrates in the mushroom and potatoes. Went for the most fun and beautiful hike to Eagle Rock right after this breakfast was devoured last weekend. Happy to report it sustained me for the entire 5 mile duration...I didn't even dig into the trail mix in my CamelBak.<br><br>
That's a lie, there was chocolate in it.

	<li>Pre heat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>

	<li>Place potato chunks and garlic on a baking sheet, drizzle 1 T of the olive oil over the veggies and then sprinkle with a little bit of salt and pepper.  Bake for about 30 minutes, stirring a couple times with a spatula.  They're done when you pierce them with a fork and they are tender.</li> 
	<li>While the potatoes are a-roastin' start getting the mushrooms ready.</li>

<h1>Pumpkin Spice Latte Pancakes</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/pumpkinspicelattepancakes.png"></p>


<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">So this whole living on the second story with no AC in the dead of summer gig is getting a leeeeeettle old.  As evidenced by my mini fan in constant motion; the poor thing is about to give out.  The other evening while perspiring in my desk chair, I began to day dream of autumn....
<br><br>
This recipe evolved from that fantasy.  I mean come on, pumpkin?  It's not even September.<br><br>
But Starbucks has announced the arrival (though somewhat on the down low) of their famous Pumpkin Spice Latte, so I HAVE to follow suit.  Rich, gooey pancakes made with buttery pureed pumpkin, strong coffee, and a plethora of cozy autumn spices.  These pancakes are gluten free, dairy free, egg free, soy free, nut free.  They are not, however, caffeine free  <br><br>Now I can have my coffee IN my pancakes.

Genius.

Coffee AND chia seeds?  Addiction = fueled.<br><br>
This week is going to be hectic with finals, all my internship duties, and trying to plan what to do with my short couple weeks of "summer break," though I will be working pretty much the whole time.  But I'm still smiling because that means cozying up at a coffee shop on a Friday night and reading, playing with my best friend and her daughter while they are in town, and dreaming of pumpkin spice lattes in my very near future
</p>
<hr>



<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
	<li>2 1/4 cup non-dairy milk (I used almond milk)</li> 
	<li>1 cup pumpkin puree (if making from fresh pumpkin, it will be more liquidy than the canned pumpkin so I would remove 1/2 cup of the non-dairy milk to supplement)</li> 
	<li>2 T instant coffee powder</li>
	<li>2 T coconut oil + some oil for the pan</li> 
	<li>1 chia egg (1 T chia seeds + 3 T water...can also use same formula with ground flax)</li> 
	<li>1/2 cup sugar</li> 
	<li>2 cups all purpose gluten free flour (can also use whole wheat or all purpose)</li> 
	<li>2 tsp baking powder</li> 
	<li>1 tsp baking soda</li> 
	<li>1/2 tsp salt</li> 
	<li>1 1/2 T pumpkin pie spice...(or can make your own using 1/2 tsp ground allspice, 1 T cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg)</li> 
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Start by making up the chia/flax egg.  Mix 1 T chia seeds with 3 T water and let it sit in a little bowl for 5 minutes, until it coagulates and becomes gooey!</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, beat together the pumpkin, non-dairy milk, coffee, oil, and sugar.  Mix in the chia/flax egg when it&#8217;s ready.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and spices and stir.</li>
<li>Slowly add the flour mixture to the milk/pumpkin bowl and stir until it just becomes combined.  Batter should be relatively runny (see photo above).  Feel free to add more non-dairy milk if it appears too dry.  But don&#8217;t get cray.</li>
<li>Heat a griddle or large flat skillet to medium, give the pan a quick coating with oil and pour a spoonful of batter onto the pan.  Warning, these pancakes refused to come out round, think Picasso and get creative mkay.</li>
<li>Cook until you see tiny bubbles appear, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.  Makes enough pancakes to feed 3-4 hungry peeps.</li>

<h1>Toasted Coconut Banana Pancakes</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/toastedcoconutbananapancakes.png"></p>


<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">Am I right, or am I right?
<br><br>
Sometimes you wake up and you&#8217;re like, Eggs, let&#8217;s do this. Or usually in my case, lethargic bowl of cereal, come to me.  Other mornings you rise and it&#8217;s like Woah&#8230;pancakes, how on god&#8217;s green earth did I survive the past 5 weekdays without your carbohydrate fluffiness in or around my mouth?<br><br>
I don&#8217;t know, either. This breakfast gives Jack Johnson&#8217;s hit &#8220;Banana Pancakes&#8221; a run for its money.  It&#8217;s easy. It&#8217;s delicious. It&#8217;s pretty. <br><br>
There has been plenty, plenty of times where I really want pancakes in a bad, bad way but let&#8217;s face it sometimes we just don&#8217;t feel like whipping out every bowl from the kitchen and going to town. Perhaps the reason being we stayed up too late the night before.  Saturday night, I&#8217;m looking at you.<br><br>
Sometimes we want something easy peasy. This recipe is made in the blender! You just toss the ingredients in and whirl it up. Throw in stuff like a smoothie&#8230;AND OUT POPS PANCAKES. Pretty fancy if ya ask me. Sweet bananas, wholesome oats, a little honey and some crunchy coconut to round it all out&#8230;these flapjacks are the perfect way to kick off my favorite day of the week! Bonus: they are also free of sugar, wheat, and any dairy.<br><br>
If you&#8217;ve never replaced an egg with chia or flax seeds while baking, it&#8217;s the bees knees.  And it&#8217;s been a staple in my kitchen for a long time now. Knock out the cholesterol that would normally inundate pancakes by replacing the egg with ground flax/whole chia seeds and swapping out coconut oil for butter.  Chia seeds are chock full of fiber and omega 3 fatty acids while coconut oil boasts high levels of antioxidants and lauric acid (which has beneficial effects on cholesterol levels).  Can you say healthy saturated fats? What a paradox. Toasting the coconut probably takes the most skill in this recipe, but even that requires just a few stirs and some good old fashioned patience. You can do it. Pancakes, come to me.
</p>
<hr>
<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
	<li>2 cups old fashioned rolled oats (gluten free, if desired) or 2 cups oat flour</li> 
	<li>1 1/2 cups toasted shredded coconut (directions below)</li> 
	<li>2 cups vanilla almond milk (or any non dairy beverage)</li>
	<li>1 large ripe banana</li> 
	<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li> 
	<li>1 1/2 heaping T honey or agave nectar</li> 
	<li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li> 
	<li>1 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li> 
	<li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li> 
	<li>1 T chia seed for the &#8220;egg&#8221; (flax seed will work too, directions below)</li> 
	<li>3 T water</li> 
	<li>Coconut oil for cooking</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Start by throwing shredded coconut on a baking sheet at about 350 degrees until it begins to brown. Try to spread it out as evenly as possible. Stir frequently so none of the shreds burn, I would say the overall process takes about 10-15 minutes. Set aside half of the toasted coconut for the topping of the pancakes and place the other half in the blender. Do not blend yet.</li>
<li>Put the oats into a food processor and grind until you make oat flour.  You can also purchase oat flour in the store if you are <del>lazy</del> void of a food processor.  But you should probably invest in one.  Soon.  They&#8217;re amazing. Add the 2 cups of flour to the blender. Again, hold off on blending just yet.</li>
<li>To make the &#8220;egg,&#8221; just combine 1 T of chia/flax seed with 3 T of water.  Let it sit for 5 minutes until it coagulates and becomes gooey or gummy; this will be your binder instead of egg! Add egg to blender.</li>
<li>Then add all other ingredients except coconut oil to the blender and blend it up.</li>
<li>You may have to add more milk or water if the batter is too thick. Use your own judgement here because unfortunately I&#8217;ve got a busy schedule this week and am not able to peer over your shoulder with one eyebrow raised.</li>
<li>Heat up coconut oil in a large skillet. Pour a medium sized spoonful of blender batter onto skillet and fry up until bubbles begin to appear.  Then flip and fry the other side.  Side Note: Don&#8217;t go Mount St. Helens-ing on me when the first pancake turns out looking a little jacked up. The first one always behaves strangely&#8230;.be patient and the other ones will come out round and all swell-lookin&#8217;. Promise.</li>
<li>Top with the rest of the toasted coconut, some organic maple syrup, and even some almond butter if you&#8217;re feelin&#8217; crazay.</li>

<br><br>Valentine&#8217;s Day: I see you.  I also see a buttload of recipes posted up on the blog world for chocolate this and cookie that and red velvet pancakes and yadda yadda yadda.<br><br>
I mean, you&#8217;re going to need to balance out all those boxes of Sees, right?  Do it with something from the earth.  Something simple, fresh, and healthy.<br><br>
Radicchio, an Italian chicory, is tossed with a generous heap of peppery arugula and their invigorating bitterness is complimented with sweet blood oranges, toasted almonds, and a honey-rich tangy citrus dressing.  This salad is beautiful and tasty.  Is there a more perfect match in the culinary world?<br><br>
NAH.<br><br>
So where do bright red, orange, and yellow fruits and vegetables get their vibrant hues from?<br><br>
Les nerd out for a second: Beta-carotene! It&#8217;s what we call a &#8220;provitamin&#8221; and once ingested, these carotenes get converted into Vitamin A to aid in vision, gene expression, cell growth, and countless other vital processes in the human body. Thank you, biochemistry lecture.<br><br>
This Valentine&#8217;s Day, surprise your babe with a colorful dish made up of healthy ingredients and a dressing to knock your fuzzy socks off.  Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day to all you lovers out there.

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
		<li>1 head of red radicchio</li>
		<li>3 blood oranges</li>
		<li>2 cups arugula, or other pile of mixed greens</li>
		<li>1/4 cup slivered almonds</li>
		<li>1/2 lemon</li>
		<li>1 tsp honey or agave nectar</li>

		<li>1/8 tsp sea salt</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Begin by toasting the almonds.  This simply requires you to chop the almonds into slivers, place on a baking sheet covered in tin foil, and bake for 6-9 minutes at 375 degrees.  Don&#8217;t skip this ish- it&#8217;s amps up the flavor profile tremendously and brings out a rich nutty flavor otherwise undetectable in raw almonds. Promise. Swear on my mother. JK mom you&#8217;re better than that. They&#8217;re done when they begin to turn a light brown color and give off a toasty aroma, WATCH THEM CLOSELY AND STIR THEM FREQUENTLY WITH A SPATULA OR WOODEN SPOON OR ELSE THEY WILL BURN. ALL CAPS. THIS MEANS SHIZ IS SERIOUS.</li>
<li>Next, chop up that radicchio into bite-size leaves and toss with arugula and almonds.</li>
<li>Take one of the blood oranges and slice off the two ends and peel.  Take a sharp knife and segment the orange. Toss with the salad leaves and almonds.</li>
<li>For the dressing, slice the two remaining oranges and squeeze the juice into a bowl. Pick out any escapee seeds.  Then repeat for the 1/2 lemon.</li>
<li>Whisk in the honey/agave, the vinegar, salt, pepper, and lastly, the olive oil.</li>
<li>Drizzle the dressing over the salad and serve up a dish that you can be proud of. Because we all know them red velvet cupcakes be coming later. Or box of cheap shitty chocolate&#8230;ain&#8217;t no shame in your VDay game.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
<br><br>Hi, weather? Is that you? Oh, hi it&#8217;s Cory, and I have to admit you&#8217;re leaving me more confused than my chemistry textbook.  One day you&#8217;re above 80 and I&#8217;m drinking a Dogfish poolside and the next it&#8217;s pouring down rain. It would be lovely if you could make up your mind!  I dreamt up these wonderful sammich&#8217;s when it was hotter than purgatory and now I&#8217;m bundled up in my rain jacket cursing the sky because I can&#8217;t ride my bicycle.<br><br>
Wellllll, I am going to post this recipe anyway <br><br>
BBQ sauce is inextricably reminiscent of summer time, just the mere aroma of it can send me delving into a wonderful summertime nostalgia. But what to slather it in if you don&#8217;t eat meat? Tempeh! DUH! If you have never heard of tempeh, well today is your lucky day.<br><br>Tempeh is similar to tofu, but in my opinion, much better. It&#8217;s dense, chewy, and much more similar to meat than tofu.  You can buy it at most grocery stores in the natural food section! It&#8217;s basically fermented soy; and before all you health-food-phobics tear your hair out and run the other way screaming, that just means it&#8217;s easier for us to digest!  Along with offering up a hefty amount of protein and B vitamins, tempeh is a probiotic; it contains bacteria good for our gut.  Please don&#8217;t get me started on which bacteria because I am a gigantic microbiology nerd and won&#8217;t be able to stop myself once I start.<br><br>
Rhizopus Oligosporus.<br><br>
Okay sorry, that was it. I&#8217;m done. I feel much better now.<br><br>
BBQ and coleslaw&#8230;they go together like peas and carrots.  Only better.  <br><br>
This recipe perfectly pairs tempeh smothered in a thick smokey homemade BBQ sauce with a tart refreshing and crispy apple coleslaw. Squash it between two pieces of bread and we&#8217;ve got a duo that&#8217;s sexier together than Brangelina.

</p>

<hr>

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
	<ul>
<li>8 oz package of tempeh</li>
</ul>
<p>For the BBQ Sauce:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.5 cups ketchup</li>
<li>1.5 T white vinegar</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tsp pepper</li>
<li>1/4 tsp paprika</li>
<li>2 T liquid smoke</li>
<li>1 T sweetener of your choice: honey/brown sugar/agave</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Slaw:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups red cabbage</li>
<li>1 large green apple</li>
<li>2 T olive oil</li>
<li>2 T apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>1 T honey/agave</li>
<li>juice of 1/2 lime or lemon</li>
<li>salt/pepper</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Prepare the tempeh first: cut the block into thin strips and steam for 10-15 minutes.  Lay strips in a glass baking dish and set aside</li>
<li>Now make the BBQ sauce!  Add all ingredients in a sauce pan and heat, stirring very frequently over medium heat for about 10 minutes.  Stir that sauce like your life depended on it. The fate of this sandwich rests solely in your hands. I mean whisk. Add more paprika for more heat, and less liquid smoke if you prefer a less smokey sauce.  If you&#8217;re a fan of sweeter BBQ sauce, add more sweetener, but calm down you sugar fiend, not too much because it will burn faster when you cook the tempeh.  Trust meh.  Taste and add more salt/pepper if you deem it necessary.</li>
<li>Smother the tempeh in the sauce, coating both sides, and let marinate for at least an hour.</li>
<li>When the tempeh is more saucy than my mother on Mardi Gras, it&#8217;s ready to bake.  Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, then flip the tempeh and bake another 10.</li>
<li>While the tempeh is cookin&#8217;, prepare the slaw.  Cut the cabbage and apples into really thin strips.  Mix all the liquid ingredients and add in the apples and cabbage at the end, coating them sufficiently.</li>
<li>Toast up some carb-e-liscious bread (or gluten free bread&#8230;) and stack tempeh and slaw in between. For a more savory sammich&#8217;, I would switch out the cabbage in the slaw for carrots, add 2 T tahini to the slaw, and then layer a slice of gouda cheese in there. This ain&#8217;t no Burger King, but you can still have it your way.</li>

<h1>Broccoli Tahini Salad</h1>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
<br><br>I know the word &#8216;broccoli&#8217; doesn&#8217;t always whip you into a ravenous frenzy, but this fresh twist on that little cruciferous vegetable is so worth raving about!   I went very light on the dressing for these photographs because I didn&#8217;t want to scare you away with vegetables soaked in all this brown liquid and&#8230;they did turn out pretty.  But I smothered it in sauce afterwards and was 100%  satisfied in doing so. Don&#8217;t be afraid to get saucy on a Tuesday night, guys.<br><br>
This festive crunchy little salad tosses fresh bite sized crispy veggies in a savory creamy dressing.  You&#8217;re probably like, &#8220;Vegetables worth drooling over?&#8230;.Chyeah right.&#8221; <br><br>
But this salad&#8230;<br><br>
Such wow.  Much green.<br><br>
And&#8230;.umami!  Some people have heard this word but don&#8217;t know the full definition.  It&#8217;s science!  Umami is a taste that is basically found in foods rich in the amino acid glutamate.  Commonly referred to as &#8220;the fifth flavor,&#8221; umami is abundant in foods like beef, chicken, and pork and is commonly described as savory and salty.  This is why some people go bonkers for bacon.  Like I said, science, baby.
<br><br>
Anyways, the point of this nerdy rambling is that this salad evokes some of the pleasurable sensations we feel when we taste umami. I have many friends who tell me they don&#8217;t feel satisfied after eating a meal made without meat.  And this is <strong>totally</strong> valid!  Along with other likable qualities (likable to some&#8230;), meat has such high levels of this umami flavor that the tastebuds become accustomed to this. Dare I say it again, it&#8217;s science.  Man, Bill Nye would be SO proud. It&#8217;s unbelievably satisfying, but made without a trace of umami-rich meat.  My meat-eating friends helped themselves to seconds, and thirds of this salad.  The dressing contains yummy nutty tahini (basically nut butter made out of sesame seeds and a main ingredient in hummus) with a zing of fresh ginger and the salad features creamy avocado and crunchy cabbage and broccoli.  A perfect and blissful blend of vegetable power, healthy fats from the avocados and seeds, and protein from the beans. <br><br>
This is a very fresh salad, and one that should be (and normally tends to be) devoured quickly.  Once made, eat it that day or save it for one more day. After that, you run the risk of harboring a big bowl of very sad, soggy salad.  Ohhh avocados, you temperamental little rascals, you.<br><br>
This is an absolutely perfect dish to bring to a BBQ, a picnic, or some other social function where you can impress your friends with an absolutely amazing and healthy salad, and beat out that boring bowl of macaroni salad we have all had 85 million times.

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients"><p>For the salad:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 bunch of broccoli</li>
<li>1/4 cup chopped red onion</li>
<li>1 cup diced red cabbage</li>
<li>1/2 cup shredded carrot</li>
<li>1 can chickpeas/garbanzo beans</li>
<li>1 handful fresh cilantro</li>
<li>1 ripe avocado</li>
<li>juice from 1/2 lemon</li>
<li>1/4 cup sunflower seeds (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the dressing:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 T tahini paste</li>
<li>4 T soy sauce or gluten-free tamari</li>
<li>1 T fresh grated ginger (or 1/4 tsp ground ginger)</li>
<li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>3-5 T water, depending on thickness desired</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol><li>Start by getting all ninja in the kitchen and slicing and dicing those veggies into small bite sized pieces.  Once the broccoli is chopped, blanch it: boil it in salted water for 2-3 minutes.  Then drain and submerge in icy water.  Drain again and pat dry. This will cook the broccoli but preserve its crunch!</li>
<li>Toss all veggies, the beans, cilantro, and the sunflower seeds in a large bowl.  Save the avocado and lemon for last.  This way you cut down the chances of the avocado getting smashed.  Avocado&#8230;.why you so sensitive?</li>
<li>Now for the dressing, whisk tahini paste and soy sauce/tamari in a small bowl.  By the way, for those that are mildly interested or curious, tamari is a wheat-free version of soy sauce (and thus a favorite among a gluten-free-sushi-loving crowd).</li>
<li>Whisk in the water, garlic powder, and ginger.  Taste it and add in the appropriate amounts of salt and pepper. Everyone is different in how salty or peppery they prefer their food so I thought I&#8217;d leave this one open to self experimentation.</li>
<li>Gently mix the dressing in the veggies.  Once served, keep salad in the refrigerator. Salad, how you so tasty?</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
<br><br>What is it about a fresh, juicy taco and a cold beer on a Tuesday that makes the work or school week so much easier to get through?   I can&#8217;t pin point the answer for you but Taco Tuesdays are probably the best thing since sliced bread.  I do love bread, but tortillas&#8230;everyjuan loves tacos.  Right?<br><br>

My friends and I started doing Taco Tuesdays a while back; sometimes we would go to a Mexican restaurant and other times we would cook in someone&#8217;s apartment.  Sadly, our schedules no longer allowed for these Tuesday fiestas and so we moved them to Thursdays.  Hence, Thaco Thursdays were born.<br><br>

That&#8217;s right.  I said Thaco.

<br><br>
This recipe will fly far, far beyond your wildest veggie taco fantasy.  Sure we&#8217;ve all had beef or chicken tacos, even tofu or just bean tacos.  Boring.  I&#8217;m snoring.
Swap out your same-old same-old tacos for these delicioso spicy lentil tacos!  Or&#8230;burritos depending on the type of tortilla you wrap it in and whether or not you want to add in the rice.  Take my word on this one, you want it.  The lime and cilantro bring plain brown rice to the next level.  You&#8217;ll be saying &#8220;Chipotle who?&#8221;<br><br>

Lentils are simmered with spicy adobe peppers and sweet, crunchy organic corn.  This taco filling is so good, you absolutely will not miss any meat.  Scout&#8217;s honor  Throw in some salsa, avocado, and a healthy whole grain tortilla&#8230;and you&#8217;ve got yourself a match made in Mexican cuisine heaven.

<br><br>

The peppers come canned and are found in the international aisle in your grocery store or in a special market.  Gather all your amigos and make these tacos for your next Taco Tuesday!!! And don&#8217;t forget to add some Corona, Tecate, or margs to the mixture.  Ole.

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<ul>
<li>Tortillas (whole wheat flour/corn, I used Ezekiel Sprouted Grain&#8230;)</li>
<li>1/2 cup lentils, I found a delicious sprouted green/black/brown trio in my local health food store but any will work</li>
<li>1/2 cup sweet corn</li>
<li>1 3/4 cups vegetable broth (for lentils)</li>
<li>1 chipotle pepper in adobo (comes canned in the international food section of the grocery stoee) + 2 T of the adobo sauce in the can</li>
<li>2 limes</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>1 tsp cumin</li>
<li>1/2 cup uncooked brown rice</li>
<li>1  1/4 cups water or vegetable broth (for rice)</li>
<li>1 T chopped cilantro</li>
<li>1 avocado</li>
<li>1/2 large ripe tomato</li>
<li>1 handful of raw spinach</li>
<li>salsa, whatever kind you prefer</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li> Begin with the brown rice, it can take a while to prepare.  If you have a rice cooker and are all too familiar with using it, great- throw in the rice and 1  1/4 cups water/broth and call it a day.  If not, use a large sauce pan, bring those two ingredients to a boil and then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 40-50 minutes until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Check rice after 30 minutes because we are all well aware that each stove is a unique snowflake and cooking times may vary 😉</li>
<li>Let the rice stand for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.  Squeeze the juice of one lime into the rice.   Gently stir the cilantro into the rice.  Set rice aside.</li>
<li>For the lentil taco filling, combine 1 3/4 cups of the vegetable broth with 1/2 cup lentils in a medium sauce pan.</li>
<li>Mince the chipotle pepper finely and add it, along with 2 T of the adobo  sauce from the can, to the lentil and broth.  I added even more sauce because I reallllllly like my food spicy.  Use less if ya can&#8217;t handle all dat heat.</li>
<li>Bring the entire mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until the lentils are tender (15 minutes).  Don&#8217;t overcook as lentils will become mushy and sog-tastic. If you are using split lentils, the cooking time will be much less.  Taste and add more adobo if you can handle it. This stuff is super spicy- you have been warned.  Add in the salt, garlic powder, and cumin.</li>
<li>Cook corn accordingly&#8230;I bought organic frozen sweet corn and cooked via directions on the package.  Then add cooked corn into the lentil mixture when it is done. If using fresh corn, simply stir in corn when lentil pot is down cooking.</li>
<li>Squeeze juice from one lime into lentil/corn mixture and gently stir.</li>
<li>Dice tomatoes</li>
<li>Cut avocado into strips of creamy goodness</li>
<li>Optional: Heat up tortillas by placing one tortilla in a clean, dry skillet on the stove on low heat.  Flip tortilla when it becomes warm and begins to crisp up.  It&#8217;s done when it&#8217;s warmed on both sides. Repeat for however many tortillas you are making.</li>
<li>Line tortilla with some spinach, then tomatoes, then a couple spoonfuls of cilantro lime rice followed by some of the lentil/corn mix, then add avocados and, if you so choose, a generous spoonful of spicy salsa.  Wrap up and devour. Ole.</li>

This bright and colorful dish is full of exotic, robust flavors that melt in your mouth.  Nutty, fluffy quinoa is slowly simmered in creamy coconut milk and zesty curry spices.  Garbanzo beans, peas, and kale are added in for fiber, protein, and color.<br><br>

<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 cup uncooked quinoa (I used red quinoa but use whatever color of the rainbow you fancy)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 13.5 oz can full-fat coconut milk</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 15 oz can cooked chickpeas (same as garbanzo beans, chill out if you thought you bought the wrong one)</li>

<li>Zee first order of business is cookin&#8217; that quinoa.  Most bags will have cooking instructions but in case you went full-hippy and got your quinoa from a bulk bin or something, combine 1 cup dry quinoa with the coconut milk in a medium sized pot.  Quinoa requires a 1:2 cooking ratio, so if you&#8217;re using 1 cup of dry quinoa, you&#8217;ll need 2 cups of liquid.  Measure out the coconut milk, if it doesn&#8217;t reach 2 full cups, use water for the rest.  If the whole can isn&#8217;t used, toss out the rest or use it for something else <img src="http://thesavvysweetpotato.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then cover and let simmer slowly for about 15-20 minutes until almost all liquid is absorbed and mixture looks a bit creamy.  Quinoa is properly cooked when the seeds have &#8220;sprouted&#8221; into little white kernels.  When you deem it done, remove the pot from the heat and let sit on the counter, *still covered,* for about 10 minutes and fluff with a fork.  This prevents quinoa from clumping and produces a nice, fluffy finish.</li>
<li>If using frozen peas, cook via stovetop or microwave according to bag.</li>
<li>Drain and rinse chickpeas.</li>
<li>Chop the kale into small bite sized shreds.</li>
<li>Combine quinoa, peas, chickpeas, and kale. Toss in the vinegar and all the spices, except the salt!  Taste test your bowl via shoveling large spoonfuls into mouth.  If it needs salt, which it probably will, add it in by 1/4 tsp increments to avoid over-salting.</li>
<li>Sprinkle with sesame seeds and red chili flakes. Enjoy it hot or cold; it goes both ways, baby.</li>

Cheers to a hot, steaming bowl of soup on a dreary day that is incredibly filling, exceptionally creamy, and completely plant-based and good for you.  Hands down, this is one of the tastiest soups I have made to date.  I am really excited to share this recipe with you!  Roasted winter root vegetables are pureed with fresh herbs like rosemary and thyme and the flavor combination will knock your fuzzy little socks off.  White beans are added for protein and yummy coconut milk is swirled in to create a creaminess that is pretty much addictive.  Make this soup, take a true food nerd&#8217;s word for it

<ul><li style="text-align: left;">5 cups vegetable broth</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 poblano pepper, diced but don&#8217;t seed it</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 sweet potato, peeled and diced</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 parsnips, peeled and diced</li>

<li style="text-align: left;">1 cup full-fat coconut milk</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 15 oz can white beans (cannellini or great northern)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 tsp lemon juice</li>

</ul>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>First you have to roast all dem veggies&#8230;once this is done the soup practically makes itself promise. Pre heat oven to 400 degrees F and line two different baking sheets with tin foil.  On one sheet, place the sweet potato and rutabaga.  On the other, arrange the pepper, parsnips, carrots, and garlic.  Give each tray a generous dousing of cooking spray.  We&#8217;re separating the baking sheets because they take different times to roast!  Usually, the rutabaga/sweet potato takes the longest.</li>
<li>Place sheets in the oven and check after 15 minutes.  The parsnips/peppers/carrots/and garlic should be done after about 15-20 minutes, when they&#8217;re tender and starting to brown- they be done. Keep checking so they don&#8217;t burn.</li>
<li>Leave the sweet potato and rutabaga in anywhere from 35-45 minutes depending on your oven.  I actually took the sweet potato off the tray after about 30 minutes and kept roasting the rutabaga for an additional 15.  Every oven is a unique snowflake- keep checking frequently to avoid scorching veggies/burning home to ground.  The veggies are sufficiently roasted when tender after being pierced with a fork.</li>
<li>When all the veggies are nice and roasted, transfer to a high speed blender.  Mince the roasted garlic finely.  Add in all remaining ingredients (spices, coconut milk, beans, fresh herbs, veggie broth, I&#8217;m lookin at you&#8230;and even you, lemon juice, you can come too)</li>
<li>Puree the crap out of the mixture until a thick, orange soup is produced.  Taste test- every veggie broth is also different so if yours needs some *pop,* add in another pinch of salt (add in 1/4 tsp increments) and lemon juice (add in a couple squeezes at a time).  Taste test until you get it right, this process encapsulates the beauty and elusiveness of soup.</li>
<li>Serve hot with a huge chunk of toasted bread. Or just eat with spoon. Hell, pour it into an IV drip at this point.  SOUP&#8217;S ON!</li>

<p id="description">
Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I think mashed potatoes are basically the culinary equivalent of wrapping oneself in a fuzzy blanket, moisturizing socks, and sitting in front of a crackling fireplace.<br><br>
You better hide them potatoes from me on Thanksgiving, because I will eat all a&#8217; dem for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, brunch, brinner, snacks, mid night snacks, movie snacks, okay. I&#8217;m done. You get the idea.<br><br>
Thanksgiving was not even that long ago, and once again mashed potatoes are making a much-welcomed appearance in my kitchen.<br><br>
Toss out your old butter-n-cream ridden recipe for delicious bliss&#8230;Comfort food just received a new and improved <em>healthy </em>makeover.<br><br>
This recipe is a nutritious twist on an old family classic; to achieve the desired level of creaminess without all the fat and dairy (cows, we&#8217;re puttin you out of business), these spuds are whipped up with tahini and soymilk and smothered in a nutritious and hearty gravy made with mushrooms and tamari.<br><br>
Potatoes have gotten a bad reputation&#8230;and for no good reason.  Did you know one medium potato contains half our daily value of Vitamin C? AND, did you know they also contain more potassium than bananas? As for tahini, if you&#8217;ve never tried it, this sesame seed butter delivers a rich dose of calcium, vitamin E, and healthy mono and polyunsaturated fats that have been proven to help lower blood cholesterol.<br><br>
This weekend, I hope you can make up a steaming batch of these mashed potatoes and gravy, wrap yourself in a fuzzy blanket, put on moisturizing socks, and sit beside a crackling fireplace. Basically I hope you spend the weekend winning at life.

<li>Start by peeling the potatoes and dicing those babies into small chunks.  Throw them into a large pot, cover with an inch of water, then boil for 10-15 minutes or until you fork them and they&#8217;re nice and soft.</li>
<li>Drain the potatoes and mash them. I used my standup mixer to get them into the consistency I wanted (now that I&#8217;m a real chef) (just kidding) (so snobby), but you can definitely use a fork or a potato masher.  Return them to the pot and over low heat, stir in the tahini, garlic, and soymilk. Add in the lemon juice, salt, pepper, and nutritional yeast.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
I realized something about myself the other day; I am perpetually thinking about people, places, and things in terms of food.<br><br>
When I met my boyfriend, I had no words to describe what I thought about him; all that I could manage to repeat over and over again was, &#8220;he&#8217;s a total onion.&#8221;  My girl friend looked at me like I was nuts.<br><br>
&#8220;Cory, what?&#8221;<br><br>
&#8220;He&#8217;s an onion. He has all these different layers you can peel off before you reach the core. I like that.&#8221;<br><br>
I will typically think of someone less-than-warm-and-friendly as an unripe cherry.<br><br>
Or perhaps a problem has been haunting me like lingering garlic breath.<br><br>
Regardless, this makes for an interesting dialogue in my head and spurs a lot of creativity in my life.<br><br>
I was jonesing for some Italian the other day&#8230;something not too rich and heavy but something with a bold flavor that would still satisfy.  I had basil on my hands and fresh summer tomatoes on my mind&#8230;  So I turned my pipe dreams into pesto polenta.<br><br>
Pesto made with phenolic antioxidant rich olive oil and fresh basil bursting with vitamin K is combined with creamy iron laden cornmeal.  This mixture is baked to perfection in a fresh red tomato, topped with protein and calcium high mozzarella cheese and drizzled with a delicious thick balsamic glaze.  This dish makes for a great entree or appetizer! And because it&#8217;s just so aesthetically pleasing, it&#8217;s perfect to serve up to friends (that is, if you feel like sharing.)

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">4 large semi-ripe tomatoes</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3/4 cup pine nuts</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">4 oz basil</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">4 cloves garlic</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 cup olive oil + 1 T for garlic drizzle</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3 tsp salt</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp black pepper</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3 1/2 cups water</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 1/4 cups corn meal</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">4 thin sliced rounds of mozzarella cheese</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">balsamic glaze for drizzling</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees (for da garlic&#8230;)</li>
<li>Start by making the polenta!  Bring the 3 1/2 cups of water to a brisk boil over medium high heat.  Add in 1 tsp of the salt.</li>
<li>Carefully pour the cornmeal into the water, whisking ever sooo gently.</li>
<li>Keep whiskin&#8217; until the cornmeal starts to get thicker than Colin Farrell&#8217;s eyebrows. No offense, Colin. Turn the heat down to low.</li>
<li>Cook the polenta on low for about 35 minutes, stoping to whisk and scrape down the sides of the pot every 10 minutes.  Set aside.</li>
<li>While the polenta is cooking, roast the garlic. I roasted the whole head&#8230;to do this, simply shop the top off the head of garlic, drizzle in a little olive oil (about 1 T), wrap in tin foil, and bake in oven for 30-40 minutes, checking after 30.  The cloves are done when they are pierced with a fork and feel tender.  They should be a creamy consistency. To roast just the amount necessary, simply wrap several clove sin foil and roast in the same method above, but this may take less time so check on them frequently.</li>
<li>Toast the pine nuts.  Reduce oven heat to 350 after garlic is done roasting.  Spread nuts out evenly on a piece of tin foil on a baking sheet and bake at 350 for about 8 minutes.  Every oven is different, be careful not to burn them!  Stir and check them every couple minutes.  They&#8217;re done when they turn a light brown color.</li>
<li>In a food processor, add in the olive oil, toasted pine nuts, basil, black pepper, and 2 tsp salt.  Process until relatively smooth.  Taste test and see if it needs more salt or pepper, or even more oil. It&#8217;s tempting to eat straight from the bowl with a spoon. Do not do this. Patience is a virtue&#8230;or some shiz.</li>
<li>Gently stir the pesto into the polenta mixture.</li>
<li>Next, carve out the inside of the each tomato with a small knife, first cutting the top stem off and then scooping out any gooey flesh.</li>
<li>Fill each tomato with some pesto polenta (you will probably have leftover polenta)</li>
<li>Place tomatoes in a baking dish and broil at 350 for about 7 minutes.  After 7 minutes, top each tomato with a mozzarella round and broil for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
<li>Take out tomatoes, let cool, and drizzle a thick (or thin, whateva you got on hand) balsamic vinegar over each one.</li>

<h1>El Salvadorian Pupusas</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/elsalvadorianpupusas.png"></p>



<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
The first time I ever had a pupusa, I thought I was going to die.  No, not faint from the delectable combination of gooey melted cheese and warm corn tortilla in my mouth.  Actually die.<br><br>
Flashback to High School, when I had just gotten my first car and a girlfriend of mine from told me she wanted to take me to a special grub spot downtown, so we got into my car, Lola was her name, and we drove.  And drove and drove and drove.  Almost an hour later I was so f***ing hangry I could have ripped off pieces of the steering wheel and funneled them down my esophagus.  FINALLY, we pulled up to a crumbling ramshackle restaurant with dirty windows, three large men with thick black mustaches out front, and a flickering neon sign that read &#8220;Pupuseria.&#8221;  Poo poo what? I thought to myself, this is it Cory.  This is the end. I traveled 45 minutes outside of town to be stuffed into a trunk and have my eyelids sold for $3.75 a pop.<br><br>
Ahhhh, little did I know that once we got inside, I was going to bite into something incredible&#8230;something so undeniably fresh and fluffy and exquisite that I actually would have endeared the steering wheel appetizer if it meant I could eat a handmade pupusa everyday for the rest of my gringa life.<br><br>
You may be wondering what a pupusa is exactly (pronounced Poopoo-saw&#8230;heh, poo).  It&#8217;s a traditional El Salvadorian food, basically meat and cheese stuffed in between a corn tortilla pocket, much like a quesadilla.  Usually it is eaten with curtido, a zippy cabbage relish that counters the richness (and also godliness) that is a pupusa.  Since moving to Los Angeles and seeing Pupuserias all over town, it has been my dream to make them from scratch. I must admit I have a newfound respect for the ladies (and gents) that slang these poopies, I mean puppies, on the daily- like most things in life it probably gets easier the more you do it, but my first one was struggs city.  Nevertheless, the subsequent ones got better and better.  Here is how to make homemade, healthier pupusas sans the meat and grease that even a slightly-frightening-thick-black-mustached muchacho would highly approve of. He may even nod, tip his hat, and whisper, &#8220;Si.&#8221;

<h2>Makes about 6 pupusas.</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 cups masa harina, an instant corn flour.  Can we white/yellow/blue.  Most grocery stores carry this in the &#8220;ethnic&#8221; food section</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">at least 1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the filling:</p>
<ul style="text-align: center;">
<li style="text-align: left;">1.5 cup black beans</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 tsp olive oil</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 small red onion</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3 cloves garlic</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 serrano (leave seeds in if you&#8217;re a BAMF)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 lime</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">salt and pepper</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2-3/4 cup shredded cheese (I use Daiya vegan mozzarella cheese)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>The first thing you want to do is mix up the dough.  You can do this easily by hand or if you&#8217;re a wimp (just kiddin) use an electric mixer&#8230;I did.  I admit it.  Add in the flour and salt and then pour the water over and mix.  You may have to add in more water to get the dough the right consistency.  Add it in slowly, in 2 tablespoon increments until a soft, pliable dough forms that is neither too sticky nor too crumbly.  Think cookie dough status. I ended up placing a small bowl of water on my work station so I could dip my fingers into it and add more water to each one as I formed the pupusa paddies.  Shape the dough into one large ball and set aside. Work on the filling rather quickly so the dough doesn&#8217;t dry out.</li>
<li>To make the filling, mince up the garlic and onion as finely as you can.</li>
<li>Heat up a skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil.  Toss in the garlic and then the onion and saute until fragrant (3-4 minutes).  When done, transfer to a bowl.</li>
<li>Chop the serrano pepper up, and add it into the bowl along with the black beans, cilantro, and garlic/onion mixture.  Take a fork and smash the pupu out of it (heh..that was the last one) until a chunky paste forms.  I stopped mashing once the texture became kind of like guacamole.  Taste it and decide how much salt and pepper to throw in, adding them in  1/4 tsp increments.  Set bowl aside, next to a small bowl with the shredded cheese.</li>
<li>Now take the giant dough ball and gently roll it into 6 or 7 smaller sized balls, between the size of a golf ball and baseball.</li>



<li>Next, you want to indent the ball of dough until a little hole forms.  Move your fingers carefully so that you get a little dough UFO. Cute, right.</li>
<li>Take a spoonful of the filling and a pinch of cheese, and load it into the dough disc.</li>
<li>Once you feel like there is enough filling to satisfy but not too much so that the pupusa won&#8217;t shut, start to fold the dough over the filling to enclose it.</li>
<li>Work that little mass of dough until you shape it back into a disc that is as flat as possible, without allowing any of the filling to leach out.  Which it inevitably will. But I promise, the more you make, the better you get.</li>

<li>Heat up a griddle or a really flat skillet to medium heat.  Once hot, chuck a pupusa onto the surface (NO oil required :)) and fry for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown.  Then flip the pupusa and fry the other side until it looks similar.  Repeat for remaining filling-stuffed dough balls. Yums, yes.</li>

Baked hash.<br><br>
I smell an opportunity for a few herbal jokes&#8230;but, because my grandma might read this, I will abstain.<br><br>
Who am I kidding? My grandma still uses a type writer. [Insert marijuana joke].<br><br>
This was my first time caramelizing onions at home in my kitchen. Rookie move, you might say. And I wouldn&#8217;t disagree&#8211;the patience it requires can be a bit of a deterrent. But, like most everything in life. Worth. the. wait.
<br><br>
Nestled in between flash fried purple cabbage, supple creamy onions, and chewy sweet potatoes are 4 fresh eggs that will burst with runny yolk upon one poke from your fork. So from a nutritional standpoint, you&#8217;ve got a complete meal on your plate&#8211; fiber, fats, protein, and complex carbs. And whatchu know &#8217;bout that thyme sprinkled on top? It&#8217;s not just for decoration&#8211; studies show that the oil from this fresh zesty herb is a potent antiseptic with anti-cancer properties that can also help normalize your blood pressure. The Romans used to use it to flavor their alcoholic bevs&#8230;hmmmm, duly noted.

<h2>Serves 4.</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<ul>
<li>3 T + 1 tsp extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
<li>2 yellow onions, sliced thinly</li>
<li>2 large sweet potatoes, chopped</li>
<li>1/2 head purple cabbage, chopped/shredded</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
<li>8-10 sprigs fresh thyme, minced</li>
<li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->

	<ol>
<li>First things first, Preheat your oven to 450 so it&#8217;s all ready to go before you begin anything else!  Then caramelize those onions into ooey gooey vegetable candy. Heat up medium sized heavy bottom skillet over medium high, pour just enough olive oil to coat the bottom (~2 T).  Add the onions in and give &#8217;em a shake of salt and pepper.  Turn heat down to medium low and cook the onions down&#8230;.like&#8230;cook the shit out of them.  Caramelizing onions is a true labor of love, you cannot rush it. You&#8217;ll need to heat these babies for at least 45 minutes, mine took about an hour. You want them super soft and gooey with a lovely dark brown color. Stir frequently to ensure even browning and keep an eye on &#8217;em.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tsp olive oil over medium high and saute the cabbage until it starts to become tender (~6-8 mins).  Give it a shake of salt and pepper, then remove from heat and set aside.</li>
<li> In a large bowl, combine potatoes, 1 T olive oil, paprika, garlic, and some salt and pepper on a foil lined baking sheet. Bake at 450 for 35-45 minutes, until potatoes are tender. Set aside.</li>
<li>When the potatoes and onions are done doin&#8217; their thang, turn down the oven to 425. In a cast iron skillet or oven-proof skillet, layer the potatoes and onion on the bottom, then add the cabbage. Make a few holes in the veggies using a spoon and carefully drop the eggs in. It&#8217;s okay if they&#8217;re on top, too.  Either way is A-okay. Bake about 10 minutes, until the whites of the eggs set and look opaque.  You can test it by poking the yolk with a fork.  If it&#8217;s still soft and gooey and the whites are set, it&#8217;s chow time. If you prefer less runny yolk porn, then allow the mixture to bake a bit longer until the yolks are harder when you stab them via fork.</li>
<li>Take out of oven, sprinkle with fresh minced thyme and go to breakfast town.</li>

<p id="description">
Easy and delicious one pot, or even two pot soups, totally rock my socks off.<br><br>
And I&#8217;m not even wearing socks.  Because the calendar says it&#8217;s *cue Dr. Evil air quotes* &#8220;November&#8221;&#8230;but it&#8217;s 84 degrees outside and I yam sweating.<br><br>
I mean, on a scale from 1 to Britney-with-no-hair, how crazy would I look if I started blasting christmas music in my apartment right now?<br><br>
I&#8217;m gonna do it.  And my neighbors will have to deal with the musical manifestations of my semi-psychotic winter wonderland hopes and dreams.<br><br>

Moving on, I am souper excited to share this cozy, filling stew recipe with you today. It was inspired by a trip to an Ethiopian market a few weeks ago.<br><br>Ethiopians make a lot of vegetarian one-pot stews (called Wat) and use a lot of lentils, collard greens, and fiery spices like Berbere (a mixture of cayenne pepper and ginger)!<br><br>My kinda peeps&#8230;basically.<br><br>
This flavorful soup combines toasted red lentils, stewed leafy collard greens, and a variety of zesty spices that will warm you up and nourish you from the inside out. The beautiful part about soup is that you can basically use whatever vegetables you have on hand. I happened to have a lot of leftover green beans and bell peppers, sooo I tossed zem in!<br><br>
Feel free to substitute something different like mushrooms, tomatoes, or corn. Just sub in the same amount instead of the green beans and bell pepper!

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 cup dried red lentils</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">8 cups veggie broth</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 bell pepper, chopped</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 white onion, chopped</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 cup green beans</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">6 cups collard greens, chopped and rinsed</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3 T olive oil</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/3 cup lemon juice</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 T turmeric</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 cup nutritional yeast (optional, but of course recommended<li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 T chili powder</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 T dried thyme</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 T cumin</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"> 1 T red chili pepper flakes (use less if you prefer less heat) (weenie) (totally kidding)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">salt/pepper (use at your discretion&#8230;)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Grab your biggest pot!  Pour 1 T of the olive oil into the bottom and add the onion and garlic.  Saute over medium high heat until they become pretty soft and tender.  Then add in the bell pepper and cook for a couple more minutes.</li>
<li>Toss in the dried red lentils and stir them along with the veggies for one minute. Add in the green beans and the veggie broth and bring it all to a boil!  Once boiling, reduce heat to simmmmmmer and cook for about 20 minutos.</li>
<li>While the soup is bubbling, grab a deep pan and bring it to medium heat.  It may appear you have a plethora of collard greens, dear chef, and this is very true.  However, these greens will cook down a lot.  Just trust me 😉 Once zee pan is hot enough, pour in the remaining 2 T of olive oil and toss in the collard greens and lemon juice.  Add a little salt and pepper (about 1/8 tsp of each) and saute until greens become soft and wilted.</li>
<li>When the soup has been cooking for about 20 minutes, add in the wilted collard greens and the spices.  I am not sure which veggie broth you are using, some have higher a sodium content than others.  So, add in all the spices and save the salt and pepper for last.  Simmer for 10 minutes over medium heat and then taste your soup.  If it tastes bland at all, salt is your new BFF.  Add in salt in 1/2 tsp increments until you get the taste just right. Add in pepper this way, too.</li>
<li>Voila. Look at you, you stew-master, you. And cheers to, Africa, thank you for your delicious meal inspiration.</li>

When it comes to comfort food, sure you can grab a bag of chips and go to china town on some Flamin&#8217; Hot Cheetos.  But I can&#8217;t guarantee you&#8217;re going to feel GREAT after said comfort-seeking venture.  In my humble opinion, there is something amazingly therapeutic about a souper big steamy, creamy bowl of homemade soup.  Especially when the soup can be easily concocted in one large pot.  Doesn&#8217;t get much better than that.
<br><br>
I&#8217;ve got finals this week and you better bet I will be slurping this soup for the next 5 days straight.  It&#8217;s a great dish to make on the weekend and just reheat throughout the week.<br><br>
You can sloppily throw it together on a weary Sunday night by adding in fiber-protein-zinc-calcium-niacin-packed lentils, vitamin-A-rich carrots, and vitamin-D-containing mushrooms.  It&#8217;s loaded with spices that impart incredible flavor and bursting with fresh heart-healthy veggies and legumes.  What&#8217;s not to adore?<br><br>
Put on that Snuggie, dig in with a spoon, and get yo&#8217; comfy on.

<h1>Pesto & Mushroom Pizza</h1>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
Back in the good old days, (does anyone else feel 85 when saying this phrase?) before I had sprouted a real curiosity or knack for anything within the culinary realm, my best friend and I would always just make Top Ramen when we got hungry.  I&#8217;m not sure if my parents were hoarding copious amounts of these enriched noodles in case of WWIII but we always had enough in stock to feed 65 armies.  Being the chefs at heart we were, we would always mix together one beef and one chicken flavored packet and and we called it &#8220;Beeficken.&#8221; My, oh my, how we have come a long way.<br><br>
Well, my best friend still eats Top Ramen.  Taylor don&#8217;t kill me, please.  But I will say I have learned just a few things since then. For instance, take pizza.<br><br>
In college, pizza was a staple.  No, I don&#8217;t want to talk about the freshman 50.  That&#8217;s right, I said 50. That, along with Taco Tuesday, and having my name on a plaque in the local bar for drinking 50 days in a row (I went to Santa Barbara, don&#8217;t look at me like that), was how we survived.  This is an entirely different pizza than I would have chowed down on in university.  And, for that I am proud.<br><br>
Rich pesto is slathered on whole wheat dough and it bubbles and bubbles and toils and troubles alongside red onion and mozzarella until creamy crunchy Nirvana is reached. <br><br>
Moving forward, I decided to get all house on the prairie and make my own pizza dough.  I thought to hell with it, I&#8217;m already going this far, now there is no turning back.  I will post the recipe below, and although a bit labor intensive, the taste of homemade whole wheat thin crust is unsurpassable. Take my word on this one.<br><br>
The pesto is pretty quick and easy. It&#8217;s so good, I swear I could just slather this stuff on the dough and call it dinner. Pine nuts and fresh basil form the backbone.<br><br>
Your typical pesto recipe calls for parmesan cheese.  You may certainly add this in, if you so choose, however this recipe uses nutritional yeast instead.  Nutritional yeast is an amazing dairy swap out for cheese, and it&#8217;s loaded with vitamin B, folic acid fiber, and protein.  You can find it in the bulk bins or natural food section of your grocery store&#8230;it has a nutty cheesy flavor and comes sold as a yellow powder.  This amps up the flavor of this pesto fantastically.<br><br>
I also used vegan cheese on this pizza, but you can certainly use mozzarella too.  My favorite brand of vegan mozzarella is Daiya, you can get it in many standard grocery stores.<br><br>
If you so choose, you can purchase pre-made pizza dough or even pre-made crusts.  Trader Joe&#8217;s has a great whole wheat dough that you can take home, roll out, and use as crust.  My word, with the amount of times I mention Trader Joe&#8217;s in my blog they should make me their spokeswoman.  I just love that store- it&#8217;s cheap, healthy, and the people are always so nice!  Whole Foods is great and I could get lost in there for hours but I always end up spending my entire paycheck in .6 seconds.



</p>

<hr>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<p>For the crust:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour&#8230;and a little more for dusting</li>
<li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
<li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 cup warm water</li>
<li>1 T olive or avocado oil</li>
<li>1 T cane sugar</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Begin with the most difficult part: getting the water the right temp for the yeast to grow.  If you have a thermometer, you can use that.  Water should be heated until about 105-110 degrees (F).  If you don&#8217;t have one of these fancy tools, use your best judgement when I say &#8220;warm&#8221; water.  Press your hand to the bowl and if it sears your fingers, it&#8217;s too hot.</li>
<li>When you have the right temp, add the yeast and 1 tsp of the sugar.  Let sit for 5 minutes with a dish towel covering it.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, mix together 2 cups of the flour, the salt, and remaining 2 tsp of sugar in a large bowl or electric mixer with paddle attachment.</li>
<li>When yeast mixture is done sitting, form a well within the flour mixture and slowly drizzle in the olive oil.  Then add in the water/yeast/sugar mixture and stir until combined.</li>
<li>Using a muscular arm or a dough hook in your mixer (pick your poison my friends) knead the dough and keep adding in flour in 1 T increments until dough forms a ball and is no longer sticky.  Should take around, oh, 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Once formed into a ball, place in lightly oiled bowl and let it sit, covered with a dish towel or saran wrap, for 45 minutes. During this time the dough should have risen like jesus on easter.</li>
<li>After it has risen, punch the dough down and form into a compact ball again.</li>
<li>Dust a cutting board with some more whole wheat flour and with a rolling pin, roll out dough into the shape of a circle approximately the size of your pizza pan.  Let sit for about 10 minutes.  It&#8217;s now ready to bake! You can also be more time efficient than me and make this dough the day before.  Before rolling out, just wrap the dough ball in plastic wrap and place in fridge.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
I walked into Trader Joe&#8217;s and it was as if I had transcended Los Angeles and entered into October-land.  Pumpkin cream cheese.  Pumpkin scones.  Pumpkin coffee.  Might as well sell pumpkin spice toilet paper.  It&#8217;s like a pumpkin patch hayride you can&#8217;t get off of.<br><br>
But I have to jump on the wagon (pun intended) because, let&#8217;s face it. What&#8217;s Halloween without pumpkin carving?  Sad, so sad. And what&#8217;s Halloween without pumpkin ale?  Depressing, that&#8217;s what. And what gives punkin&#8217; its bright orange color?  It is loaded with beta carotene, a terpenoid hydrocarbon which gets converted into vitamin A in the body&#8230;yessir, the same thing you find in derrrricious carrots.<br><br>
Well I thought I was being <strong>so</strong> productive.  I popped my pumpkin into the oven before my hike and figured it would be perfectly roasted upon my return&#8230;<br><br>
I got home, flung open the oven door, put that sucker on the counter, and gave it a quick stab with my knife.  The whole thing made this weird kind of gurgle sound, wilted, shrank, and then <em>completely</em> collapsed into the pan.  Needless to say, it was a multi-tasking kitchen fail.  Ya win some, ya lose some, I suppose.<br><br>
Round 2 was considerably more successful&#8230;as I have discovered through self experimentation, it turns out the cooking times for pumpkins vary <strong>a lot </strong>and you really need to just keep an eye on it while it&#8217;s in the oven.<br><br>
I first concocted this recipe last Fall, pre-The Savvy Sweet Potato blog and I loved it so much, I had to bring it on back.  Sup, pumpkin chili. I missed you. This is such a creative and unique way to serve yummy chili; with each scoop of delectable spicy soup, a chunk of pumpkin flesh comes with it&#8230;and the combination is out of this world.<br><br>
Ps. This recipe has a secret ingredient that balances the heat wit&#8217; a lil sweetness.

<!--Recipe Serving-->
<h2>makes 5-6 servings of soup</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<ul><li style="text-align: left;">1 medium pumpkin, preferably with a flatter bottom. Kim Kardashian pumpkins, get outta&#8217; here.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 15 oz can (or 1.5 cups cooked and drained) kidney beans</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 15 oz can (or 1.5 cups cooked and drained) black beans</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 15 oz can (or 1.5 cups cooked and drained) pinto beans</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp olive oil</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 cup sweet yellow corn</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 red bell pepper</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 green bell pepper</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 red onion</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3 cups vegetable broth</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">5 garlic cloves</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 T chili powder</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp cumin</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp *unsweetened* cocoa powder 😉</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (more if you like it on the spicy side&#8230;)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">a couple splashes of soy sauce or tamari</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">salt, black pepper, and paprika to taste</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
<li>Begin by roasting the pumpkin.  If you&#8217;ve never done this before, don&#8217;t be scurrrred.  It&#8217;s so easy and the best way to scoop out the insides without all the arm work.  Simply stab the top of the pumpkin a few times with a large knife (gently&#8230;don&#8217;t get all 1996 and go Scream on it), place in a baking dish or cookie sheet with about 1/4-1/2&#8243; water in it, and place in the oven at 425 degrees for&#8230;.the amount of time really varies!  It could take as little as 30 minutes or as much as an hour and half, depending on the size and variety of pumpkin.  I would check on it every 20 minutes or so!  The pumpkin is done when it turns a darker color and when you poke it with a knife, the flesh feels like an old school r&amp;b song&#8230;so soft and tender. Mmmm. Yes.</li>
<li>When the punkin&#8217; is cooked through, take it out of the oven and let it <strong>cool</strong>!  Sever the top off by just slicing it open and tearing it off.  It should be relatively easy, if it&#8217;s not, it may mean the pumpkin isn&#8217;t done yet.  Once the top is off, scoop out the insides (not the flesh, but the seeds and strings) with a metal spoon.  Try to get as much out as possible, being careful not to puncture the flesh too much. You can save the seeds and get crafty with them later; maybe roast them with some pepper &amp; garlic salt&#8230;oooo look at you, all domesticated! Watch out.</li>
<li>While the pumpkin is roasting up nicely, you can work on dat chili.  Begin by dicing the bell peppers and onions into small bite sized pieces and mincing the garlic really well.  Throw the onions and garlic in a large pot with the olive oil over medium heat and saute until tender and fragrant.  Then add in the bell peppers and cook until tender.</li>
<li>While the veggies are sizzling, rinse the canned beans under cool water in a colander (skip this step if you cooked the beans yourself) and add to the pot along with the veggie broth, corn, and tomatoes.  Stir, stir, stir.  Stir until you feel like you can skip arm day at the gym.  Leg day, not so much.  That schmuck&#8217;s still comin&#8217; for you.</li>
<li>Bring the pot to a boil, and cook the soup for about 35-45 minutes until it&#8217;s nice and thick.  When it&#8217;s almost done, add in all the spices, soy sauce and cocoa.  Taste it and see if it needs more spice, salt, etc.  Hint: If it tastes at all bland, simply add salt&#8230;and then if it still needs more flavor, move onto the other spices!</li>
<li>When it&#8217;s to your liking, take the soup off the stove and pour into the cooled pumpkin.  When serving, use a soup ladle and gently scoop out some of the pumpkin flesh along with the chili.  Garnish with seeds if you really want to impress your date. Or your mom. Or your cat, in my case. Aaaaaand, Happy Fall.</li>

<p id="description">


	Quinoa&#8230;you sneaky little seed you.  It took me a long while and many failed attempts to learn how to pronounce you.  Why oh why do you have to be spelled the way you are? There happens to be a quinoa salad we serve at my work and you can&#8217;t guess how many people with good intentions just fail miserably when trying to order.  Let me shave off a few moments of utter confusion for you.  It&#8217;s pronounced like-a this:<br><br>
	&#8220;keen-wah.&#8221;<br><br>
	Now you, too, can appear hoity-toity in front of someone who works at a deli.<br><br>
	Despite its strange pronunciation, it&#8217;s one of my favorite go-to meal basics.  Quinoa is amazing for so many reasons!<br><br>

	I like to refer to quinoa as the (sub favorite actor/actress here) of the nutritional world.  Although it is plant based and a seed, it can imitate animal based proteins and play the main role in a meal.  This is due to the fact that quinoa actually has a pretty hefty amount of protein.  It can sub in for rice, pasta, cous cous, you name it.<br><br>

	In my recipe, this delectable south american grain is smothered in a creamy avocado cilantro dressing; the tanginess of the lime and cilantro really mix well with the sweetness of the cranberries.  The red cabbage and sunflower seeds also give each bite a nice crunch.<br><br>
	I always eat my quinoa on top of a bed of greens.  Nommmmms.  P-to-tha-S: This picture is total deception. I used WAY more dressing when I actually ate my salad&#8230;.Don&#8217;t judge me.

</p>

<hr>



<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<p style="text-align: left;">For the quinoa:</p>
<ul><li>1 cup quinoa</li>
<li>2 cups vegetable broth or water</li>
<li>1/2 cup cranberries</li>
<li>1/2 cup sunflower seeds</li>
<li>1 cup diced red cabbage (about 1/4 head of cabbage)</li>
<li>2 carrots</li>
</ul>
<p>For the dressing:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 T oil (I used avocado oil but canola or olive would work as well)</li>
<li>2 T rice vinegar</li>
<li>1 T water</li>
<li>3/4 cup diced fresh cilantro</li>
<li>1 avocado</li>
<li>1 tsp agave syrup (or honey)</li>
<li>1/8 tsp chili powder (I used 1/4 tsp but that&#8217;s only because I prefer my food to burn my lips off, adjust according to your own taste)</li>
<li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>juice from 1/2 lime</li>
<li>salt/pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol><li>Start by getting the quinoa cooking!  In a large saucepan, combine the dry quinoa with the broth or water.  Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes.  When quinoa is done, you will see the white germ sprout and you will be able to fluff with a fork.</li>
<li>Cover quinoa and LET SIT for 15 minutes.  This allows the extra moisture to be absorbed so your quinoa doesn&#8217;t come up runny. Yucky.</li>
<li>Chop red cabbage into very tiny pieces and shred the carrots using a cheese grater.</li>
<li>Mix with cranberries and sunflower seeds and when quinoa is dry and fluffy enough (wow are we at the groomers now?) combine all dry ingredients, including fresh veggies, together.</li>
<li>For the dressin&#8217; fixens&#8217;, combine all ingredients in a food processor.  The cilantro may take a while to ground finely, so be patient and keep whizzing that button around.  If you lack a food processor, it is possible to really finely chop the cilantro and mix all ingredients until combined.  The consistency will be chunky instead of creamy, though.  I have not tried this method but I can imagine the results would be alright.  Food processors are the bees knees, though. Just sayin.&#8217;  A vita mix or even nutri bullet would also potentially fill in.</li>

<p id="description">
I mean correlation does not equal causation, but coincidence? &#8230;yes.
<br><br>
I wish I could run outside but something about the hard pavement gets my knee all cranky-like. I feel like everyone says they have a &#8220;knee issue&#8221;&#8230;come to think of it my whole family has knee problems. Like, it&#8217;s becoming clear to me that my ancestors weren&#8217;t the ones cunningly outrunning the saber tooth tigers.  They were the ones hiding in the bushes gorging themselves on tree nuts until the stampede had passed.<br><br>
Welcome summer humidity. It took my five minutes just to pull my skinny jeans over my sticky legs this morning, my hair looks like Marge Simpson&#8217;s, and the only consolation on my 1 hour and 15 minute long traffic-infested commute home from work (4.8 miles in total, mind you) is that there is a big bowl of cold pad thai waiting in my refrigerator. Leftovers; you get me, you really, really get me.<br><br>
This dish is a healthy spin on a favorite Thai classic of mine, with crunchy spiralized zucchini and carrots in place of rice noodles.  If you have never thought about getting a spiralizer, they&#8217;re cheap, and FUN. The &#8220;zoodles&#8221; are doused in a thick, creamy, rich, peanut buttery tamari ginger coconut sauce.  Oh, and I threw in a bunch of thai chilis so you know that bad boy is spicy AF. Toss cilantro, green onions, peanuts, and sauteed shitake mushrooms into the bowl and holy moly. Too. Good. <br><br>
NOTE***Don&#8217;t be scared by the long list of ingredients, once you have them&#8230;.the dish seriously comes together in a snap. You also don&#8217;t have to add every garnish I suggest, although all the different components make it interesting and more authentic, feel free to omit if your wallet is looking at you like WTF.



</p>

<hr>



<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<p style="text-align: left;">For the sauce:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 cup smooth peanut butter</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 cup low-sodium tamari (or soy sauce)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3/4 cup water</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp peanut oil (veg oil works too)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2-4 thai chilis, minced finely (or 1 serrano&#8230;.use 1 or 2 thai chilis if not into HOT heat, 4 is more my flava)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 T fresh ginger, minced or grated</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 T chili garlic sauce (find it in the ethnic section of the market)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp black pepper</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">juice of 1 lime</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 T tamarind paste (this adds a little sweetness&#8230;find it in an asian market or maybe the ethnic section of the market)</li>
</ul>
<p>For noodles and garnish:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 raw green zucchini</li>
<li>1 raw yellow zucchini</li>
<li>2 carrots</li>
<li>1/4 head of purple cabbage</li>
<li>1 red bell pepper</li>
<li>3 cups edamame, shelled (I used frozen)</li>
<li>handful of peanuts (for garnish)</li>
<li>1/2 cup cilantro, chopped</li>
<li>1/2 cup mung bean sprouts</li>
<li>1/2 cup green onions, minced</li>
<li>sesame seeds (for sprinkling)</li>
<li>2 limes, cut into quarter wedges</li>
<li>2 cups shitake mushrooms (I left stems on but you&#8217;re technically just supposed to use the caps. Whatever forever)</li>
<li>1 tsp peanut oil (veg oil works too)</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
	<ol>
	<li>Begin to make the sauce by heating a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Heat the peanut oil (1 tsp) in the pan and add the garlic.  Saute for 3 to 5 minutes, until softened and starting to brown slightly. Add the minced thai chili and the ginger and cook for another minute.  Turn down to low.</li>
<li>Add in the remaining ingredients from the sauce list, stirring frequently, until sauce begins to thicken and bubble slightly (about 7-10 minutes).  Do not let it boil! Turn off heat and set aside.</li>
<li>In a small skillet, heat the remaining 1 tsp of oil over medium heat.  Add in the shitake mushrooms, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and saute for about 4-5 minutes&#8230;until shrooms get a little nice and tender-like. Set aside in a separate bowl.</li>
<li>For the oodles of noodles, if you&#8217;ve got a spiralizer&#8230;simply spiralize the crap out of the zucchinis and carrots.  We&#8217;re on the hunt for perfect ribbons, but this is not always the case when your spiralizer costs $21.99.  Do the best you can. If you are void of this tool, you can grate these veggies or if you&#8217;re lacking a spiralizer but have all the time in the world, julienne them.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">

As a youngin&#8217; my mother feared for my lack of domesticity.<br><br>
I was assigned to do the family&#8217;s laundry and I felt like a pair of red shorts could chill with all the whites in the washer and they could work out their differences. When everyone had to suffer through bright pink underwear for the next few months, I began to think about color sorting.<br><br>
I failed miserable at sewing. Think of the shower scene in Carrie when I accidentally stitched the tip of left pinky onto a pleated skirt.<br><br>
My first attempt at baking involved a sleepover with my best friend and we were craving some chocolatey brownies in the wee hours of the night. Instead of 1 cup of sugar, we tossed in 1 cup of baking soda&#8230;At 2 o&#8217;clock in the morning we were bombarded with the loudest BOOM you could imagine as the oven door burst open and thick gooey brownie batter exploded into every crevice of the kitchen.  Shockingly, Mom was less than pleased.<br><br>
Even after years of working in restaurants, studying nutritional science, and my love for all things kitchen related, mom still says &#8220;I never imagined you would be the cook in the family.&#8221; When I served her this salad on a hot July afternoon, I was hoping to make up for my less-than-desirable homemaker attributes.<br><br>
&#8220;Hey ma, look what I can do.&#8221;<br><br>
Roasting these sweet summer peaches with a little honey and fresh lemon juice takes their flavor and sends it through the roof. Grilling the peaches would also be PFT (pretty f*%#ing tasty). Crunchy cold mixed greens, toasted walnuts, and a creamy rich poppy seed vinaigrette made with juicy mango makes for the perfect summer lunch time noms. The mint in the dressing is imperative&#8211; it adds a seriously refreshing zing.<br><br>
The health benefits of mangos are almost infinite&#8230;their high levels of vitamin C and fiber may help bring cholesterol levels down.  They&#8217;re also high in antioxidants that may protect against a variety of cancers, and despite being decadently sweet, won&#8217;t take your blood sugar levels on a roller coaster ride.  Nature&#8217;s perfect snack (aside from tacos).
<br><br>
Just kidding.<br><br>
Sort of.<br><br>
I paired this with a thick pink fillet of wild salmon and it was stupid good.  For all those who raise an eyebrow at a salmon-and-fruit combination, I&#8217;ve got a whole army of satisfied tastebuds that really, really beg to differ.

<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients"><p>For le salad:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups arugula</li>
<li>2 cups mixed spring greens</li>
<li>1/4 cup walnuts</li>
<li>2 fresh peaches</li>
<li>1/2 lemon</li>
<li>1 T honey</li>
<li>non stick oil spray</li>
</ul>
<p>For the dressin&#8217; (makes about 3/4 cup)</p>
<ul>
<li>1/4 ripe mango</li>
<li>1/2 lemon</li>
<li>1/8 cup honey</li>
<li>1/8 cup olive oil/vegetable oil</li>
<li>1/8 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>2 tsp poppy seeds</li>
<li>1 T minced mint</li>
<li>1/8 tsp sea salt</li>
<li>1/8 ground black pepper</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
<ol>
<li>First roast up them juicy peaches!  Cut them in half, remove the pits, and drizzle with juice from 1/2 a lemon and 1 T of honey.  Line a cookie sheet with tin foil and give a light spray with oil.  You can also drizzle a little bit of oil on the sheet and swirl it around with a paper towel.  Decisions, decisions.  Bake at 425 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until tops and edges around the tops begin to darken and shrivel. Don&#8217;t let it burn, baby. Grilling these bad boys instead would be amazing, too!</li>
<li>Toast the walnuts (whole- do not chop up) by spreading them out evenly in a single layer on a tin foil covered baking sheet and baking for 5-10 minutes at 325 degrees or until they begin to become a darker brown color and give off a sweet, toasty aroma.  Do not burn! Like, don&#8217;t even turn around to pick your nose because I swear in one second they could go from perfectly golden to black and burnt as all hell.</li>
<li>While the oven is gettin some lovin, make the dressing for the salad. In a food processor or high-speed blender, combine all ingredients except for the poppy seeds and whirl away until a smooth creamy consistency develops.  If for some reason it&#8217;s too thick, add a little water or more lemon juice (if you have more lemon).  If it&#8217;s too thin, add some more mango in.  If you don&#8217;t know the best (and prettiest) way to cut a mango, <a href="https://youtu.be/lvLdPjpELyU">Check out this vid</a>.  I have no idea who this dude is but skip to 30 seconds and he will show you the light.</li>
<li>When the dressing is pureed up, stir in the poppy seeds.</li>
<li>Arrange salad greens in a bowl, sprinkle with walnuts, add in roasted peaches, and drizzle with dressing.</li>

<p id="description">
Nothing screams summer like all the bright, fresh, juicy produce in the markets right meow.  I can&#8217;t walk by without being tempted by the succulent tomatoes, large squash, and heavy green watermelons.  Amongst a plethora of other reasons, this is why summer is my favorite time of year.  I just celebrated my 25th birthday last weekend.  I&#8217;m 25?<br><br>
Come again?<br><br>
I was standing in the middle of the hygiene aisle in the grocery store picking out a new toothbrush and naturally, I reached for the pink vibrating Hello Kitty model made for youngsters who are probably fighting their mothers at every turn of the brush.  I placed it in my basket and turned to skip on my merry way back to the delicious produce section when a horrifying thought popped into my head.<br><br>
&#8220;Cory, you are 25 years old.  You can&#8217;t just use Hello Kitty toothbrushes.&#8221;  I looked at the toothbrush.  It looked at me.<br><br>
And I put it back on the shelf, replacing it with a boring blue Oral-B.  But yanno what never gets old and boring?<br><br>
Carbohydrates.<br><br>
This simple pasta bursting at the noodles with bright fresh summery veggies is so good, so easy, so noms.  It&#8217;s got chewy roasted eggplant, crunchy toasted pine nuts, red ripe tomatos, and garlic sauteed raindbow chard.  Not to mention the organic flax whole wheat pasta&#8230;&amp; luckily no fancy shmancy time-gobbling sauce.<br><br>
It&#8217;s summer, let&#8217;s keep it simple here guys.  No body likes a dinner that&#8217;s more high maintenance than Jennifer Lopez.<br><br>
It&#8217;s just slice and dice, toss and boil, fresh, healthy, etc etc. Here is what the eggplant should resemble upon roasting, it becomes soft and a bit transparent.  Hi, summer.  I am so glad you&#8217;re here.  Now, get to work on my legs, these babies aren&#8217;t going to tan themselves. Spank you.



</p>

<hr>



<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<ul>
<li>1 package of dried pasta (I used organc flax whole wheat fettuccine)</li>
<li>1 whole eggplant</li>
<li>2 cups cherry tomatoes or 2 whole tomatoes, diced</li>
<li>1 bunch of rainbow chard</li>
<li>1/2 cup pine nuts</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves</li>
<li>2 tsp italian seasoning</li>
<li>1 tsp thyme</li>
<li>salt/pepper</li>
<li>2 T olive oil</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
<ol>
<li>First and foremost, get that pasta cooking.  Bring a large pot of water to a rapid boil and dump in dry pasta noodles.  Cover and cook for about 7-8 minutes (a little less if you prefer al dente which means it has the tiniest bit of crunch to it still).  When it&#8217;s tender enough, drain and set aside.</li>
<li>Toast the pine nuts by tossing them onto a sheet of foil (making sure they&#8217;re spread evenly for even browning) and popping them in the toaster oven.  Another way to do this is spread them evenly on a cookie sheet and bake at 375 degrees.  In either scenario, it should take around 5 minutes of cook time, and they are done when they begin to turn light brown.  Stir them a few times to redistribute the heat.  When they are done, sprinkle with a little salt.</li>
<li>If you used your oven for the pine nuts, wondaaaaaful, because now you&#8217;re going to use it for the eggplant.  Begin by slicing the eggplant into very thin, even-as-possible strips. Brush a cookie sheet with a tablespoon of olive oil and lay the slices down.  Sprinkle with the thyme, italian seasoning, and a dash of salt and pepper.  Bake for around 18 minutes.  Keep checking so they don&#8217;t burn and see photo above so you can tell if they are done!</li>
<li>Next, mince the garlic cloves very finely.  Chop up the chard into tiny pieces.  I chopped up the stem as well as the leaves <img src="http://thesavvysweetpotato.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Grab a hefty sized skillet and heat to medium on the stove.  When hot, pour a tablespoon of olive oil in, add the garlic, and saute until the garlic becomes light brown and fragrant.  Add the chopped chard and saute for about 10 minutes, until the chard wilts.  Sprinkle salt and pepper over wilted chard.</li>
<li>Combine toasted nuts, cooked eggplant, chard, and pasta.  Chop cherry tomatoes in half and garnish the pasta.  Or if you used diced tomatoes, throw them on top.  Serve while warm. Cheers.</li>

<h1>Southwestern Tempeh Salad</h1>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/southwesterntempehsalad.png"></p>



<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">

	If you know me at all, you know I love my salad.<br><br>
	And if you know me really well, you also know that that I make a GIANT pot of it every Sunday night and eat it all week.  Okay I guess only my roommate knows that.  It takes up like our entire fridge.  Basically, she&#8217;s a saint.<br><br>
	A couple weeks ago I visited my brother in San Diego and on Saturday night we decided to cook together instead of go out to eat. He told me he and his wife have recently been cooking primarily vegetarian dinners and they have been working off a great site called <a href="http://youtu.be/G6QjLjBZcqs" target="_blank">www.ohmyveggies.com</a>.  Naturally, I was pretty stoked to hear this and so we cracked open a couple beers that my brother brewed (yes, he is that cool), cranked up Led Zeppelin, and got down to bidness.<br><br>
	This recipe was inspired by the delicious dinner that we made in his kitchen.  The tempeh is marinated in soy sauce and sriracha, doused with lime, and oven baked into a spicy crispy salad topping.  And don&#8217;t think for one minute in real life I actually take the time to sprinkle sesame seeds on my food before I woof it down. HA. Oh the joys of a recipe blog.<br><br>
	If you&#8217;ve never cooked tempeh before, this is a great recipe to start with.  It&#8217;s easy, cheap, and oh sooo yum.  Try it out to impress your carnivorous friends.  They&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;whaaaaat the&#8230;wait, this sh*t is sickwitit.&#8221;

<!--Recipe Serving-->
<h2>Makes 3 servings of tempeh, and 7-8 servings of salad</h2>


<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">mixed greens and veggies for salad (I use 3 hearts of romaine, 1 red bell pepper, 2 carrots, and 1 cucumber)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 cup sweet yellow corn</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 avocados</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 package tempeh</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">3 T soy sauce or gluten-free tamari</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2 T lime juice</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 T Sriracha (or 2 T if you like it spicy like me!)</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1 tsp maple syrup</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">2-3 cloves minced garlic</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">1/4 tsp cumin</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">sesame seeds (optional)</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
<ol>
<li>Start by getting the marinade ready to rock n roll.  Give the garlic a good mincing, then combine it with the soy sauce, Sriracha, lime juice, maple syrup, pepper, and cumin in a small bowl.  Make sure all ingredients are whisked together and fully incorporated into each other.</li>
<li>Take the tempeh out of the package and crumble it into a small baking dish (mine is 9.25&#215;5.25&#215;2.75). Then pour the marinade over it, making sure each crumble gets drenched.  Mmmm.  Let it soak for at least an hour!</li>
<li>While the tempeh is a soakin&#8217; you can assemble the salad.  The salad items listed above make for a pretty huge salad, but when you&#8217;re done eating the tempeh you can use it for other meals.  Efficient right? That&#8217;s how I roll.  I shred the lettuce, dice the red bell pepper, thinly slice the cucumber, and shred the carrots into a large bowl and toss it all together.</li>
<li>Add the corn to the salad.  If using caned corn, simply drain and add in.  If frozen, prepare according to the bag and then add it in.  If you&#8217;re using fresh corn, cook however your little heart desires and then throw it in.</li>
<li>After sufficiently marinated, bake the tempeh at 375 degrees for 15-20 minutes.  It should be browned and a wee bit crispy.  Sprinkle sesame seeds over it if you&#8217;re feelin classy. Then scoop out some salad into a bowl, add some bites of tempeh, slice avocado over it, grab whatever dressing be chillin&#8217; in your fridge, and chow down. Que bueno:)</li>

<!--Recipe Image-->
<p><img style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="images/tofu.png"></p>



<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
Vegetarians can get plenty of protein from non-animal sources like beans, legumes, quinoa, grains, etc etc. If you&#8217;ve never tried to make tofu before for fear of this mushy white block that peers at you from behind the refrigerator in the hippy dippy plant protein section of the grocery store&#8230;read on.<br><br>
Tofu is an incredible food- after all it&#8217;s just basically condensed soy milk. It&#8217;s loaded with protein and a really excellent non-dairy source of calcium. It comes in several varieties that have different culinary uses&#8230;<br><br>
<em>Silken/soft: </em>the softest form of tofu&#8230;great in smoothies and baked desserts.<br><br>
<em>Firm: </em>usually what I stick with and perfect for making soups, stir frying, and eating on its own after marinating.<br><br>
<em>Extra firm: </em>this kind holds up better in a dish but to me, feels like it has a rubbery texture.<br><br>
<em>Sprouted:</em> a good option because it has almost twice the amount of protein than regular tofu, but can be more expensive. Some people also say this form is easier to digest if you&#8217;re sensitive to soy. Tummy = satisfied.  Wallet = not so happy.<br><br>
The best part about tofu is its versatility. It will absorb just about any flavor you marinate it or cook it with. Common tofu marinades around my kitchen range from soy sauce to BBQ sauce to citrus/ginger/cilantro. So now that you know more about tofu than you probably ever wanted to, here is a quick run down on how to prepare it so you can start incorporating it into some vegetarian dishes. Sound good?<br><br>

</ul>

</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">
<ol>
<li>Slice open the package and drain the water out.</li>
<li>Now we &#8220;press&#8221; the tofu to get the rest of the moisture out.  Place a couple paper towels on a plate, put the tofu block on them, and place another few paper towels on top.  Then add another plate.</li>
<li>I always grab some cans but any heavy object(s) will do&#8230;you just want some weight on the top of the plate so that the liquid seeps out.  Let sit for at least 30 minutes.  The paper towels will be saturated at the end.</li>
<li>Throw away the paper towels and slice open the block.  You can slice it any way you&#8217;d like, it&#8217;s really easy to cut through but I usually cut through width-wise once to make the block into two thinner squares.</li>
<li>Additionally, I like to cut mine into tiny triangles for stir frying but it&#8217;s up to you&#8230;to make these babies just slice each thin block into 3 strips, then cut each strip in half to make squares.  Cut each square diagonally to form triangles.</li>
<li> There you have it!  Now these are ready to marinate, stir fry, bake, etc etc.</li>

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">FACT:  we tend to overeat on holidays.<br><br>
	Not entirely sure if it&#8217;s because of family and friends nearby (Uncle Forest always seems to keep my tequila shot glass overflowing), the vast array of delicious homemade baked goods (more pie, anyone?), or the plethora of spiked egg nog (..self-explanatory&#8230;.), but I, for one, have NO regrets.<br><br>
	It&#8217;s important to enjoy the holidays; I mean that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re designed for. But when the last cookie crumb has been polished off and you can&#8217;t bear to even look at another spoonful of gravy, it&#8217;s time to snap back into reality (that pesky little aspect of life that perpetually puts on a damper on my Sunday evenings).<br><br>
	I&#8217;ve got just the ticket.<br><br>
	My winter detox salad has all da&#8217; fixins&#8217; to get you back into the healthy eating groove.<br><br>
	It&#8217;s got simple, nutritious ingredients like shredded brussels sprouts and crunchy apples that will boost your immune system and give your metabolism a chance to get back on track.<br><br>
	I love how it&#8217;s dressed so simply with just a squeeze of fresh lemon, a drizzle of olive oil, and a couple shakes of salt and pepper.  And it&#8217;s kind of too pretty to eat. But that has never stopped me before. Dig in, yo.

<!--Recipe Description-->
<p id="description">
This recipe was my first stab at healthy enchiladas. <br><br> There have been plenty of times in my life when I helped my dad make this mexican favorite.  However, our version was, like most, smothered in so much cheddar that the Kraft Cheesasaurus Rex who floats down a cheese river on a rather frequent basis would be jealous.<br><br>
Here is a healthy recipe for enchiladas, where creamy avocado sauce substitutes healthy fats for all that dairy.<br><br>
I have made these several times now.  In one version, I used zucchini instead of butternut squash but afterwards concluded that the butternut squash is a necessity.  PS most grocery stores have bags of pre cut squash if you don&#8217;t want to whack the thing open and dice it yourself.  You do you.<br><br>
The recipe below is the tried and true absolute best ever.



</p>

<hr>



<!--Recipe Ingredients-->
<div id = "ingredients">
<ul>
<li>5-6 whole wheat tortillas (or plain white flour/GF tortillas)</li>
<li>enchilada sauce (about 2 1/2 cups worth)</li>
<li>1 T olive oil</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1 can or about 2 cups of black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
<li>2 cups chopped spinach</li>
<li>1 bell pepper, diced</li>
<li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
<li>1 cup chopped butternut squash</li>
<li>2 T nutritional yeast (option but recommended&#8230;)</li>
<li>2 tsp cumin</li>
<li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
<li>juice of 1 small lime</li>
<li>salt/pepper, to taste</li>
<li>Avocado Cream Sauce (recipe below)</li>
<li>diced green onion and chopped cilantro (to garnish)</li>

</ul>

</div>

<!--Recipe Directions-->
<div id = "directions">

<li>Begin by cooking the squash.  If you&#8217;re getting all fancy and you have a whole one, simply peel it, chop it up, and cover and steam for about 7-9 minutes or until tender when pierced with a fork.  If you bought a bag of it pre-chopped, steam/boil it according to package.</li>
<li>Next, saute the onion in the olive oil over medium to low for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until onion pieces become translucent.  Now add in the garlic and reduce heat to low.  Cook for a couple more minutes until fragrant.  Next add in the bell pepper, cooked squash, black beans, and spinach.  Cook another 6-7 minutes.</li>
<li>Next, squeeze in the lime juice and pour most of the enchilada sauce into the mixture (but save a little for later!) and stir to incorporate all the ingredients.  Sauce should be thick but a little runny.</li>
<li>Now, taste it and see how salty/flavorful/bland it tastes.  I am not sure which enchilada sauce you are using so it&#8217;s up to you to determine how much of the spices it needs, but you can definitely use the above as a guide.  This is where the cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, pepper, nutritional yeast come into play.</li>
<li>When it&#8217;s just right (guess I&#8217;m goldilocks now?) take a baking dish large enough to fit 5 or 6 rolled tortillas into it and grease it very lightly.  Spread about a cup of the mixture on the bottom of the pan.</li>
<li>Place one tortilla on a plate and spoon about 3 T of the mixture onto each one.  Roll each tortilla up and place it, crease side down, on one end of the baking dish.  Repeat for the remaining tortillas.  You should have extra mixture left.  Pour the rest and the remaining enchilada sauce over the top of the tortillas and bake for about 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  Check after 20 to be safe&#8230; tortillas should be slightly browned on top.</li>
<li>Spread the avocado cream sauce over the enchiladas once they have cooled for about 10 minutes and sprinkle with green onion and cilantro.</li>

<li>1/2 cup cilantro</li>
<li>1 lime</li>

<li>1/2 tsp salt/pepper, or to taste</li>

<li>Combine all ingredients in a food processor until a creamy consistency develops.  Add more water if it&#8217;s too thick.  Um&#8230;so yeah that&#8217;s it.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t have a food processor, with (a lot) more patience, you can do this in a blender by stirring and pulsing frequently.</li>
<li>If you want to try by hand, make sure to mince the cilantro very finely and then just mash all ingredients together.  Mixture will look a lot like guacamole and be a chunkier consistency but fear not&#8230;the taste remains intact 😉</li>
